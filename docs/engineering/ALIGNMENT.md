Multi-quest persistence prerequisite qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-02 / P3-11 / P3-12 / P3-15 / initial P3-16: [per-quest durable journals](../QUEST_ENGINE.md)
pass four new and thirty legacy owned PostgreSQL contracts (34 total), exact
snapshot/receipt/XP restart checks, atomic completion rollback and a lock barrier.
Events are independent of XP kill recipes and deduplicate per character across
all affected quests. Legacy data is preserved. All 290 core / 641 network (ten
skips) / 123 client / five persistence unit tests, formatting and workspace/
all-target denied-warning Clippy pass. Ordinary Cargo's 34 ignored SQL tests were
executed explicitly in the owned runner. Preserve
`build/quest-journal-store-qualified-v1-20261102` (759 source files). Live World,
owner queues, transport/UI and native adoption remain separate; current playable
is still the schema-11 reset checkpoint. Next: bounded retained owner integration,
then World-authorized semantic events. Concurrent story documents remain planning
material with unresolved production IDs. Commit/push authorized by the user.

Multi-quest journal pure prerequisite qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-11 / P3-12 / P3-15 / initial P3-16: [bounded multi-quest proposals](../QUEST_ENGINE.md)
pass seven journal checks and all 289 core tests, formatting and workspace/
all-target denied-warning Clippy. Prerequisites unlock on completed turn-in;
indexed kill/semantic interaction events respect stages, versions and independent
quest revisions. One occurrence never cascades to a later stage. Snapshot checks
refuse inconsistent progress. Completion returns a proposal only; durable event
receipts, rewards, World and native adoption remain separate. Preserve
`build/quest-journal-core-qualified-v1-20261102` (755 source files). Next: new
multi-quest SQL ownership/receipt tables, preserving the live legacy quest.
Changes remain local; the threat draft stays archived.

Quest catalogue prerequisite qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-11 / P3-12 / P3-15 / initial P3-16: resumed with the user's authorization to
expand quests. The [versioned multi-quest catalogue](../QUEST_ENGINE.md) and offline validator
pass seven focused checks, all 282 core tests, formatting and workspace/all-target
denied-warning Clippy. Two development quests cover prerequisite links, ordered
stages and distinct NPC/kill selectors. This is pure offline code, not a new live
journal or persistence migration. Preserve `build/quest-catalog-qualified-v1-20261102`
(753 source files). The schema-11 playable remains preserved; the threat World
draft stays archived. Next: bounded multi-quest progress proposals, then separate
authority/SQL/transport/native acceptance. Changes remain local.

Creature victim-transfer prerequisites qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-07 / P4-08: [authority-only transfer hooks](../CREATURE_THREAT.md) pass six new
checks and all 275 core tests, formatting and workspace/all-target denied-warning
Clippy. Preserve leash anchor/deadline, cancel an old windup, retain recovery and
refuse invalid/late transfers atomically. These Theia hooks remain inactive in
normal World code. Preserve `build/creature-transfer-core-qualified-v1-20261102`
(748 source files). Next: prepare atomic World threat/pursuit/retaliation and
path-revision updates together. The schema-11 playable below remains qualified.
Changes stay local; no new live switching or network/native claim.

Creature threat arithmetic prerequisite qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-07 / P4-08: [bounded damage-threat calculation](../CREATURE_THREAT.md) passes ten
focused checks and all 269 core tests, formatting and workspace/all-target
denied-warning Clippy. Empirical 110%/130% thresholds retain explicit Theia
equality/tie/lifetime policies. This module is inactive in the live World; no
new victim-switching/native claim. Preserve
`build/creature-threat-core-qualified-v1-20261102`. The normal schema-11 reset
playable below remains qualified. Next: atomic opt-in World integration with
competing-player and encounter-lifecycle checks. Changes remain local.

Creature return-reset playable qualified, 2 November 2026:
P2-14 / P3-07 / P3-06 / P4-08: [normal schema-11 reset adoption](../CREATURE_RETURN_RESET.md)
binds twenty-two exact-byte roles. 259 core / 641 network (ten skips) / 123 client /
49 Python tests, formatting, workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy and release
pass. Seven normal OIDC/PostgreSQL native runs pass: passive 35-second melee,
controls/casting at three sizes and return/reacquire/kill at three sizes. Each
return run restores the same NPC from 89 to 100 HP, clears combat, reacquires and
later yields one durable XP grant and one training offer. Exactly one reset and
two acquisitions; no player death/life change. Passive contact has zero returns
and resets. GPU diagnostics and combat-event gaps are zero. Actual 1920x1200,
3440x1440 fullscreen and 1280x720 on Linux RX 7900 XTX / RADV Vulkan / Mesa 26.2.6,
connected display. Preserve `build/creature-reset-client-qualified-v1-20261102`
(744 source files) and earlier checkpoints. Injected status cleanup and two-peer
impaired UDP have separate headless evidence. No native DoT, loot consumption,
party, Windows or MMO-capacity claim. Next: bounded threat/target transfer before
population expansion. Changes are local; entries below are historical.

Creature return-reset transport qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-07 / P3-06 / P4-08: [encrypted movement/reset observations](../CREATURE_RETURN_RESET.md) pass
at 20/30/60 Hz with two real peers under delay, jitter, loss, duplication and
reordering. Moving away causes return and restores the same NPC to maximum
health, releases combat and preserves the player's life/movement stream. No
false death, respawn or award occurs. Explicit synthetic inventory and low-HP,
zero-avoidance fixtures apply; no OIDC/native/persistence claim is made here.
259 core / 639 network (ten skips) / 123 client tests, formatting and workspace/
all-target denied-warning Clippy pass. Preserve
`build/creature-reset-transport-qualified-v1-20261102` (743 source files).
Next: schema-11 normal bundle and native return/heal acceptance. The schema-10
playable checkpoint remains preserved. Changes are local.

Creature return-reset World qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-07 / P3-06 / P4-08: [opt-in health/effect reset](../CREATURE_RETURN_RESET.md) passes seven focused
World checks and 259 core / 638 network (ten skips) / 123 client tests, formatting
and workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy. Living NPC health restores once
on Return/Blocked; target effects clear, membership/tag release and old projectile
contexts remain invalid. Death/respawn is separate. Multi-rate cases use
20/30/60 Hz; status cleanup uses an explicit trusted Registry injection because
the current typed catalogue has no DoT ability. Preserve
`build/creature-reset-world-qualified-v1-20261102`. New-profile encrypted
observation checks come next; no normal reset manifest/client adoption yet.
The schema-10 playable checkpoint below remains preserved. Changes are local.

Solo tag-owner playable checkpoint, 2 November 2026:
P2-14 / P3-04 / P3-09 / P3-10 / P3-11 / P4-08: [normal schema-10 adoption](../CREATURE_CREDIT.md)
binds twenty-one exact-byte roles and authoritative solo tag-owner XP, accepted-
quest and training-offer recipients. 259 core / 631 network (ten skips) / 123
client / 47 Python tests, formatting, workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy
and release pass. Seven normal OIDC/PostgreSQL native runs pass: controls/casting
and full fights at actual 1920x1200, 3440x1440 fullscreen and 1280x720, plus a
35-second passive check. Full fights have zero returns, one combat entry/exit,
one durable XP commit and one training offer. Passive contact has zero returns
and no outgoing attacks. GPU diagnostics and combat-event gaps are zero.
Linux AMD RX 7900 XTX / RADV Vulkan / Mesa 26.2.6, connected display.
Preserve `build/creature-credit-client-qualified-v1-20261102` and earlier builds.
Two-peer recipient routing and owned PostgreSQL restart/replay are separately
qualified below. Native cases are single-player; loot consumption, parties,
shared eligibility, native Windows and MMO capacity remain unqualified.
Next: bounded encounter threat/reset before population expansion. Changes are
local. Entries below record historical checkpoints and their stated limits.

Solo credit durability qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-09 / P3-10 / P3-11 / P4-08: [public World plus owned PostgreSQL](../CREATURE_CREDIT.md)
confirms first tag-owner XP 25 / accepted-quest count 1 / one training claim;
the final hitter receives 0 / 0 / 0. SQL locking prevents acknowledgement while
fixed simulation steps advance. Replays do not duplicate; wrong-character replay
refuses. Recipient state and receipts survive PostgreSQL process restart with
fsync/synchronous_commit/full_page_writes on. Explicit synthetic account,
unequipped/no-cost Arcane and trusted quest-acceptance fixtures are used.
Formatting, workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy, one server test, build
and Python compile pass; 259 core / 628 network (ten skips) / 123 client results
are inherited unchanged. Preserve
`build/creature-credit-durable-qualified-v1-20261102`. No combined OIDC/native or
loot-consumption claim. Next: versioned normal manifest/launcher/client adoption.
Normal manifests still retain last-hit credit. Changes remain local.

Solo-recipient adapters qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-09 / P3-10 / P3-11 / P4-08: [explicit schema-2 solo tag-owner credit](../CREATURE_CREDIT.md)
passes six focused recipient checks and actual two-peer impaired encrypted UDP
at 20/30/60 Hz. All 259 core / 628 network (ten skips) / 123 client tests,
formatting and workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy pass. Only the first
effective hitter receives XP/training-offer work; final hitters receive neither.
Queue routing is not COMMIT. Preserve
`build/creature-credit-recipient-qualified-v1-20261102`. Owned PostgreSQL/public
World acceptance follows. Normal manifests retain last-hit credit; party/shared
eligibility and general corpse loot remain separate. Changes are local.

Creature-credit World qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-09 / P3-10 / P3-11 / P4-08: [opt-in first-effective-hit ownership](../CREATURE_CREDIT.md)
passes twelve focused World checks and 258 core / 621 network (ten skips) /
123 client tests, formatting and workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy.
Atomic ordinary/typed ability contributions, competing hitters, delayed spell
reset boundaries, disconnect and NPC/player life cases pass. These use explicit
fixtures at 20/30/60 Hz; no new-profile encrypted/durable or native claim.
Preserve `build/creature-credit-world-qualified-v1-20261102`. Normal rewards still
use last-hit credit. Next: versioned solo-recipient adapters and competing-player
durability; party/shared credit and per-corpse loot remain future work.
The normal playable checkpoint below remains preserved. Changes are local.

Creature-credit core prerequisite qualified, 2 November 2026:
P3-09 / P3-10 / P3-11 / P4-08: [bounded first-effective-hit ledger](../CREATURE_CREDIT.md)
passes eight focused checks, all 258 core tests, formatting and workspace/all-target
denied-warning Clippy. Ownership and contribution facts are separate from future
XP/quest/loot eligibility and durability. Exact source/proof:
`build/creature-credit-core-qualified-v1-20261102`. This is inactive pure core;
normal rewards retain last-hit credit. Next: opt-in atomic World integration and
competing-player/reset tests. The playable checkpoint below remains preserved.

Normal combat-membership playable checkpoint, 2 November 2026:
P2-14 / P3-04 / P3-06 / P3-07: [normal PL02 adoption](../COMBAT_MEMBERSHIP.md) adds a
schema-9 twenty-role bundle and an authoritative “In combat” / “Out of combat”
health-panel indicator. 250 core / 609 network (ten skips) / 123 client / 45 Python
checks, formatting, workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy and release pass.
Seven normal OIDC/PostgreSQL native runs pass: controls/casting and full fights
at actual 1920x1200, 3440x1440 fullscreen and 1280x720, plus 35 seconds of passive
melee. Each fight enters and exits combat, has zero returns, one durable XP commit
and one loot offer. Passive melee has one entry, zero exits and zero returns.
Combat/peace glyphs render; GPU diagnostics and combat-event gaps are zero.
Linux AMD RX 7900 XTX / RADV Vulkan / Mesa 26.2.6, connected display.
Preserve `build/combat-membership-client-qualified-v1-20261102` and earlier builds.
No gameplay permission consumer is gated yet; loot claim, native Windows and MMO
capacity are not qualified. Next: first-effective-hit tag and credit interfaces.
Changes remain local. Entries below are historical checkpoints.

Combat-membership transport qualified, 2 November 2026:
P1-08 / P3-04 / P3-06 / P3-07: [PL02 owner-private life/combat observations](../COMBAT_MEMBERSHIP.md)
pass 250 core / 606 network (ten skips) / 123 client tests, formatting and
workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy. Six codec tests, two actual encrypted
UDP tests and a critical-queue check cover exact policy/life binding, prediction
barriers, owner isolation, kill release, version mismatch and full/closed queues.
New-mode 20/30/60 Hz impaired two-peer evidence uses explicit low-health and
zero-avoidance special fixtures with synthetic admitted inventory. Preserve
`build/combat-membership-transport-qualified-v1-20261102` and earlier checkpoints.
Normal manifest/launcher/client HUD and OIDC/PostgreSQL/native adoption are next;
no gameplay consumer is gated yet. The normal playable checkpoint below remains.

Ability damage and melee engagement checkpoint, 2 November 2026:
[Normal ability-damage adoption](../CLASSIC_ABILITY_DAMAGE.md) uses the nineteen-role schema-8 bundle,
CE08, separately resolved Sword Slash and Arcane Bolt, and bounded typed combat
labels/effects. The wolf's 30-second allowance now refreshes on valid visible
melee contact; its captured 35 m hard leash, LOS grace and blocked-path resets
remain. This refresh rule and current coefficients are explicit Theia policies.
243 core / 588 network (ten skips) / 123 client / 43 Python checks, formatting,
workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy and release pass. Seven normal
OIDC/PostgreSQL native runs pass: controls/casting and complete fights at actual
1920x1200, 3440x1440 fullscreen and 1280x720, plus a 35-second passive melee check.
All fights have zero returns, one typed ability killing hit, one durable XP commit
and one loot offer; the passive check has one acquisition and zero returns.
Zero GPU diagnostics and combat event gaps. Linux AMD RX 7900 XTX / RADV Vulkan,
connected display; no native Windows, loot-claim or MMO-capacity claim.
Preserve `build/classic-ability-client-qualified-v1-20261102` and earlier builds.
Derived gear/class stats, resistance/absorption, ranged leash refresh and full
threat/evade/reset remain. Next: central combat membership and credit interfaces.
Changes remain local. Dated entries below describe earlier checkpoints.

Ordinary melee playable checkpoint, 1 November 2026:
[Ordinary attack tables and normal client adoption](../CLASSIC_ATTACK_TABLES.md)
pass 224 core / 556 network (ten skips) / 118 client / 41 Python checks,
workspace denied-warning Clippy, formatting and release. Six normal OIDC/PostgreSQL
native runs pass at actual 1920x1200, 3440x1440 and 1280x720, including controls,
casting, unmodified wolf perception/chase/attacks, kill and durable XP/loot offers.
Zero GPU diagnostics and combat event gaps. Linux AMD RX 7900 XTX / RADV Vulkan;
connected-display ultrawide fullscreen passed, other sizes windowed.
Preserve `build/classic-white-client-qualified-v1-20261101` and earlier checkpoints.
Native runs show normal hits, misses, dodges and criticals; level-1 wolf data does
not exercise block, parry, glancing or crushing. Those have numerical/World/codec
coverage. Static templates remain: derived gear/class stats, ability/spell starting
damage, special/spell tables and absorption/resistance are future work.
No loot-claim, Windows execution or MMO-capacity claim. Changes remain local.
Older dated entries below record previous checkpoints, not current pending work.

Inactive [ability starting-damage prerequisite](../CLASSIC_ABILITY_DAMAGE.md):
231 core / 556 network (ten skips) / 118 client tests and workspace Clippy pass.
Explicit AP-only normalization, scale/flat ordering and bounded candidate recipes
are qualified; normal abilities still use fixed effects. Separate [spell landing and conditional critical](../CLASSIC_SPELL_DAMAGE.md)
now pass 235 core tests and workspace Clippy; network/client baselines are inherited.
Main-hand-special outcomes and explicit mitigation remain before authority adoption.

Shared physical damage playable checkpoint, 1 November 2026:
[Normal physical damage authority and client adoption](../CLASSIC_DAMAGE_AUTHORITY.md)
pass 189 core / 514 network (ten skips) / 115 client / 39 Python checks,
workspace Clippy, formatting, release and six normal OIDC/PostgreSQL native runs.
All three actual sizes (1920x1200, 3440x1440, 1280x720) pass controls/casting and
unmodified wolf fights with zero GPU diagnostics. Native server summaries confirm
physical hits both ways, one durable XP award and one loot offer per kill; claiming
loot was not tested in this slice. Exact source/art/binaries/proof:
`build/classic-damage-client-qualified-v1-20261101`. Earlier checkpoints remain.
Static templates and normal-contact physical reference arithmetic are implemented;
full attack tables, derived gear/class stats and spell coefficients remain next.
Linux AMD RX 7900 XTX / RADV Vulkan, disconnected-display uncapped/windowed checks;
no connected-monitor fullscreen, native Windows or MMO-capacity claim.
Changes remain local and unpushed. Older dated entries below are historical.

Attack-table prerequisites: [ordinary melee table and eligibility](../CLASSIC_ATTACK_TABLES.md)
and authoritative creature facing pass 202 core / 516 network / 115 client tests
and workspace Clippy. Explicit outcome-aware World activation now also passes
224 core / 539 network (ten skips) / 115 client tests and workspace Clippy;
`build/classic-white-world-qualified-v1-20261101`. New-profile codec, UDP and
normal/native adoption remain pending. Actual CE07 encrypted two-peer UDP now
passes full regression: 224 core / 551 network (ten skips) / 115 client tests and
workspace Clippy; `build/classic-white-transport-qualified-v1-20261101`. The playable checkpoint above
remains unchanged.

Classic ability rules, 1 November 2026:
[Manual facing, cast interruption and weapon-timer rules](../CLASSIC_ABILITY_RULES.md)
pass 156 core / 479 network (ten skips) / 114 client / 37 Python checks,
workspace Clippy and six normal OIDC/PostgreSQL native runs at actual three sizes.
All have zero GPU diagnostics; disconnected-display uncapped/windowed conditions
are explicit. The strict development profile now demonstrates thirteen checks;
full Classic damage formulas remain pending. Current source/art/binaries/proof:
`build/classic-ability-qualified-v1-20261101`. Next: [damage resolution](../CLASSIC_DAMAGE_RESOLUTION.md).
Changes remain local and unpushed.

Damage arithmetic follow-on: [starting damage and provisional prevention](../CLASSIC_DAMAGE_RESOLUTION.md)
and candidate definition loading pass 176 core tests and workspace Clippy.
Candidate source/data/proof: `build/classic-damage-catalog-qualified-v1-20261101`.
Physical reference arithmetic and static stat-template prerequisites now also
pass (189 core tests); source/data/proof:
`build/classic-damage-physical-stats-qualified-v1-20261101`.
Explicit physical World and encrypted Renet now pass 189 core / 511 network passes
(ten skips) / 114 client tests and workspace Clippy. New-profile impaired two-peer
UDP verifies both damage directions, owner privacy and reliable continuity at
20/30/60 Hz; backpressure and kill-fact boundaries pass. Source/proof:
`build/classic-damage-transport-qualified-v1-20261101`. The normal playable
checkpoint above remains unchanged. Manifest/launcher/client/presentation/native
adoption is next; full attack tables, derived stats and spell coefficients follow.

Basic-melee transport, 1 November 2026:
[Explicit Renet engagement/state/events](../CLASSIC_MELEE_TRANSPORT.md) now
pass focused encrypted UDP checks at 20/30/60 Hz under loss, jitter and
duplication, plus presentation-queue backpressure. Formatting, workspace Clippy,
153 core / 464 network passes (ten skips) / 113 client tests pass. Exact source
and proof: `build/classic-melee-transport-qualified-v1-20261101`.
Normal application right-click/animation adoption remains pending;
playable checkpoint and strict milestone remain unchanged. Local and unpushed.

Broader world-system direction, 1 November 2026:
[Classic systems, repo assessment and working defaults](../CLASSIC_WORLD_SYSTEMS_REFERENCE.md)
now cover combat state/resolution, tagging/credit, spawns, linked encounters,
resources, control effects, navigation and corpse recovery. These are scoped
plans and policy choices; the assessment separates them from implemented code.
Finish the current strict combat slice before expanding full-zone content.
Current [headless melee authority](../CLASSIC_AUTOATTACK_AUTHORITY.md) passes
153 core / 458 network / 113 client tests; secure transport/client adoption is
next. The playable targeting checkpoint and five-of-thirteen milestone remain.
Changes stay local and unpushed.

Headless basic-melee authority, 1 November 2026:
[World weapon-timed combat](../CLASSIC_AUTOATTACK_AUTHORITY.md) passes
153 core tests, 458 network passes / ten skips, 113 client tests and workspace
Clippy. Thirteen new checks prove committed gear, range/facing/LOS/readiness
pause/resume, casts/GCD, removal, retaliation/death/respawn, stale request streams,
reward/XP facts and work/counter limits. Normal transport explicitly refuses this
unadopted profile; next is secure engage/cancel/state and client right-click
adoption. Playable checkpoint: `build/classic-targeting-qualified-v2-20261101`.
Full strict combat acceptance remains five of thirteen. Headless source/proof:
`build/classic-autoattack-authority-qualified-v1-20261101`.
Changes remain local and unpushed.

Headless combat prerequisite, 1 November 2026:
[weapon data and independent swing timing](../CLASSIC_MELEE_CLOCK.md) pass
153 core tests and workspace Clippy. Seven new checks cover timing, pause/resume,
retarget/re-engage abuse and overflow. These primitives are not enabled by the
normal executables yet. The playable build remains
`build/classic-targeting-qualified-v2-20261101`, with five of thirteen strict
combat checks. Next: authoritative World integration, then engage/cancel
transport and right-click autoattack. Metric units and deferred dodge remain.
All changes stay local and unpushed.

Targeting HUD follow-up, 1 November 2026: shortened the cycle hint to prevent
an overlap with the action bar at 1280×720. The final binary passes 113 client
tests, workspace Clippy, formatting and a fresh normal native 720p controls/
targeting run with zero GPU diagnostics; its capture is visually inspected.
Shared core/network sources are byte-identical to the qualified 146/445 result.
The preceding checkpoint retains the three-size feature checks. Current source,
binaries and proof: `build/classic-targeting-qualified-v2-20261101`.
Weapon-timed autoattack is next. Changes remain local and unpushed.

Current classic targeting checkpoint, 1 November 2026:
[persistent selection and forward/reverse Tab](../CLASSIC_TARGETING.md) pass
146 core tests, 445 network passes / ten skips, 113 client tests, 36 Python checks,
workspace Clippy and three final normal native starts with zero GPU diagnostics.
Selection survives interest/terrain unloading and turning; explicit removal and
clear remain authoritative. The classic profile identity advances to v2.
The strict combat milestone is five of thirteen checks; next is
[weapon-timed melee autoattack](../CLASSIC_AUTOATTACK_PLAN.md), then ability
facing/interaction rules. Metric scale remains unchanged. Dodge stays deferred.
Qualified source/binaries/proof: `build/classic-targeting-qualified-v1-20261101`.
Changes remain local, uncommitted and unpushed. Earlier entries retain their
historical scope; they do not supersede this checkpoint.

Formula direction: [Classic fidelity with metric units](../CLASSIC_FORMULAS.md)
is adopted. Existing development values require sourced replacements; the world
stays at 1 unit = 1 metre. This does not change frozen checkpoint evidence.

Current classic development checkpoint, 1 November 2026:
[classic controls/manual facing](../CLASSIC_MOVEMENT.md) pass 111 client and
45 Python checks, workspace Clippy and seven final native starts with zero GPU
diagnostics. The unchanged shared sources retain 142 core / 444 network passes.
Use `--classic`; dodge/action camera are disabled there. Movement/UI checks pass
at all three sizes, including an A/D-strafe settings file at 720p. Next: persistent
targeting and forward/reverse Tab, then weapon-timed autoattack and combat-facing
validation. [Enemy AI reference](../ENEMY_AI_REFERENCE.md) is recorded for
subsequent threat/evade work. The full combat milestone remains incomplete.
Changes remain local, uncommitted and unpushed.

# Current direction — strict WoW Classic foundation, 1 November 2026

The user adopted [THEIA-COMBAT-001 v1.0](../COMBAT_TARGETING_MOVEMENT_SPEC.md),
superseding the hybrid camera/movement plan. Initial controls require
character-relative movement, manual authoritative facing, persistent explicit
targeting and weapon-timed autoattack independent of abilities. Dodge, action
camera and reticle targeting are deferred. Dodge implementation remains stopped.

The [repository gap assessment and migration order](../MOVEMENT_CAMERA_TARGET.md)
start with the combat-loop contract, then classic controls/facing, persistent
selection, melee autoattack and the thirteen-check one-hostile milestone.
The `--classic` profile now supplies qualified manual movement/camera controls;
persistent selection and weapon-timed combat remain before strict-prototype acceptance. Existing movement/network/terrain, NPC, abilities,
equipment and UI foundations are retained. Earlier checkpoints below record
experimental behavior and evidence; their old “next” steps are superseded.
The local dodge animation candidate is preserved with incomplete native checks.
Changes remain local, uncommitted and unpushed.

# Retained experimental checkpoint — 2026-11-01: predicted dodge

P2-04 / P2-05 / P2-07 / P3-06 / initial P3-14: V requests one server-owned,
collision-swept dodge in either camera mode, with bounded expiring input,
profile-bound correction replay and HUD cooldown feedback. The sealed schema-4
bundle enables the opt-in normal client/server path. **100 client tests**,
**436 network passes / 10 explicit skips / 66 groups**, **43 Python checks**,
formatting and workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy pass.
All **seven final native starts have zero GPU diagnostics**, including actual
OIDC/PostgreSQL OS input at 1280×720, 1920×1200 and 3440×1440 fullscreen, plus
two-client melee/projectile regressions. Stationary dodge measures 3 m in both
camera modes at each size; panels and held-key/cooldown checks pass.
[Controls, proof and limits](../DODGE_MOVEMENT.md).
Exact source/binaries/art/proof: `build/dodge-qualified-v1-20261101`.
Earlier checkpoints remain. No authored roll, invulnerability/endurance system,
new FPS/capacity, full-workspace or Windows claim. Next: authored movement
presentation and facing/tuning. Changes remain local and unpushed.

# Historical candidate — 2026-11-01: normal-client dodge adoption

P2-04 / P2-05 / P2-07 / P3-06: normal client/server profile selection, V input,
HUD cooldown hints and a sealed schema-4 gameplay bundle are implemented in the
local candidate. The final application build passes **100 client tests**;
the validator passes **18 checks**. Full regressions and native qualification
are in progress. The playable checkpoint remains
`build/camera-panels-qualified-v1-20261101`; dodge has no native acceptance yet.
[Current behavior and remaining checks](../DODGE_MOVEMENT.md).
Changes remain local and unpushed.

# Headless checkpoint — 2026-11-01: dodge driver and expiring input

P2-04 / P2-05 / P2-07: the shared prediction driver selects profile-bound
completed-tick dodge replay, with an input edge that expires after 200 ms or
acknowledgement and clears on focus/panel/readiness loss, disconnect or changed
actor/stream. **41 targeted checks / six groups**, formatting and workspace/
all-target denied-warning Clippy pass. Actual encrypted impaired-UDP tests carry
one expiring tap through the driver and authority at 20/30/60 Hz.
[Evidence and remaining normal-client gates](../DODGE_MOVEMENT.md).
Exact headless source/proof: `build/dodge-driver-qualified-v1-20261101`.
The prior full-network result remains 427 passes / 10 explicit skips / 65 groups;
this is a targeted rerun. Normal gameplay bundles and client controls still do
not enable dodge. Playable camera: `build/camera-panels-qualified-v1-20261101`.
Next: normal client/server configuration, gameplay bundle and native controls.
Changes remain local and unpushed; no new GPU/FPS/capacity or Windows claim.

# Headless checkpoint — 2026-11-01: dodge authority and encrypted UDP

P2-04 / P2-07 / P3-06: opt-in World dodge authority and matching TC02/TP02
Renet selection pass **427 network tests / 10 explicit skips / 65 groups**,
formatting and workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy. Eleven new checks
cover actual authority/prediction agreement at 20/30/60 Hz, readiness/collision
loss, teleport, death/respawn, stationary casts, and real encrypted impaired UDP.
[Behavior, evidence and remaining gates](../DODGE_MOVEMENT.md).
Exact headless source/proof: `build/dodge-authority-qualified-v1-20261101`.
The normal gameplay client/launcher still does not enable dodge; the playable
camera checkpoint remains `build/camera-panels-qualified-v1-20261101`.
Next: bind the live prediction driver and bounded client input edges, then
normal gameplay adoption and native checks. No new GPU/FPS/capacity, Windows
or whole-workspace test claim. Changes remain local and unpushed.

# Current playable checkpoint — 2026-11-01: camera panels and HUD

P2-05 / P2-14: Escape closes dialogue, then backpack, before quitting;
classic world dragging works around open panels and HUD hints reflect the mode.
**99 client tests**, **416 network passes / 10 explicit skips / 64 groups**,
**41 Python checks**, formatting and workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy
pass. All **three final native OS-input starts** at 1280×720, 1920×1200 and
3440×1440 fullscreen have **zero GPU diagnostics** on Linux RX 7900 XTX / RADV
NAVI31, Vulkan, Mesa 26.2.6 kisak. Exact source/binaries/art/proof:
`build/camera-panels-qualified-v1-20261101`.
[Controls, evidence and limits](../PLAYER_CONTROLS.md).
The previous camera checkpoint separately retains actual two-client melee and
projectile proof; those starts were not rerun against this panel revision.
Shared dodge replay is headless-qualified; live dodge remains uninstalled.
No new full-workspace, sustained FPS/capacity, Windows or physical-input claim.
Changes stay local and unpushed. Historical entries below retain their dates.

# Headless prerequisite qualified — 2026-11-01: dodge replay

P2-04 / P2-07 / P3-06: immutable profile-bound prepared-terrain dodge prediction
and tick-aware replay pass nine new checks, with **416 network passes / 10 explicit
skips / 64 groups**, formatting and workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy.
[Exact behavior, proof and remaining authority/transport gates](../DODGE_MOVEMENT.md).
This does not enable live dodge. The panel/HUD candidate has 99 passing client
tests and built binaries at `build/camera-panels-candidate-v1-20261101`; native
checks await an agreed desktop window. The last qualified playable build remains
`build/camera-mode-qualified-v1-20261101`. Changes stay local.

# Active refinement — 2026-11-01: panel priority and control hints

P2-05 / P2-14: the source now gives dialogue/backpack priority over quitting,
allows classic world dragging around open panels, routes wheel ownership by
actual UI hover, and displays mode-specific HUD controls. **99 client tests**,
formatting and denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy pass. Native rendering/
OS checks for this refinement remain pending; the qualified playable build is
still `build/camera-mode-qualified-v1-20261101` (97 client tests / seven native
starts). Desktop input has been released to the user; no new synthetic desktop
input will run until coordinated. Next independent work is shared dodge replay.
Changes stay local and unpushed.

# Current playable checkpoint — 2026-11-01: optional action camera

P2-04 / P2-05 / P2-07 / P2-11, P3-06 / P3-14: F8 toggles action camera,
Left Ctrl temporarily releases the cursor, panels/focus suspend mouse-look,
and a raised collision-bounded aiming pivot keeps the player below the reticle.
Classic left-orbit preserves held travel; reticle clicks reuse checked targeting.
**97 client tests**, **407 network passes / 10 explicit skips / 63 groups**,
formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and **41 Python checks**
pass. All **seven final native starts have zero GPU diagnostics**, including
OS-synthetic input at 1280×720, 1920×1200, 3440×1440 fullscreen and actual
OIDC/PostgreSQL two-client melee/projectile regressions.
[Behavior, exact evidence and limits](../PLAYER_CONTROLS.md).
Matched source/binaries/art/proof: `build/camera-mode-qualified-v1-20261101`.
Earlier checkpoints remain. No new full-workspace, FPS/capacity, Windows or
physical-hardware claim. Live dodge remains uninstalled. Next: panel/input
refinements and shared dodge prediction. Changes are local and unpushed.

# Current alignment — 2026-11-01: WoW/GW2 controls

The user adopted GW2-oriented responsive movement/camera plus optional action
camera and familiar WoW/GW2 play. Retain server-owned tab-target/mobile combat
and standard Bevy; no renderer/network/physics replacement.
[Concrete scope and implementation boundary](../MOVEMENT_CAMERA_TARGET.md).
Camera modes are a 97-test source candidate awaiting native qualification;
dodge edges/codecs pass the 407-test network suite (10 explicit skips).
The qualified mouse-control checkpoint is preserved.

# Active slice — 2026-11-01: restorable dodge state qualified

P2-04 / P2-05 / P2-07 / P3-06 / P3-14: checked cooldown/active-motion snapshots
resume with identical remaining distance at 20/30/60 Hz. **138 core tests / 21 groups**,
nine filtered kinematic checks, formatting and denied-warning workspace/all-target
Clippy pass. [Exact scope, proof and upcoming wire/authority gates](../DODGE_MOVEMENT.md).
No live runtime currently selects dodge. The runnable mouse-control checkpoint
remains `build/world-input-qualified-v1-20261101`. Changes remain local.

# Active slice — 2026-11-01: shared dodge capsule prerequisite qualified

P2-04 / P2-05 / P2-07 / P3-06 / P3-14: eight new actual-Avian dodge-controller
checks pass, with **394 network all-target passes / 10 explicit skips in 61 groups**,
formatting and denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy. [Behavior and remaining
adoption gates](../DODGE_MOVEMENT.md). Pure policy remains 130 core passes. No server, wire,
prediction or client currently selects dodge. Restorable state and protocol are
next. Playable controls remain `build/world-input-qualified-v1-20261101`.

# Active slice — 2026-11-01: bounded dodge policy qualified

P2-04 / P2-05 / P2-07 / P3-06 / P3-14: eight new pure fixed-tick movement-policy
checks pass within **130 core tests / 20 groups**, with formatting and denied-
warning workspace/all-target Clippy. [Policy, exact proof and next gates](../DODGE_MOVEMENT.md).
The profile is not selected by any runtime bundle; server/controller/protocol/
client adoption and native dodge checks remain. Playable mouse controls and quest
markers stay preserved in `build/world-input-qualified-v1-20261101`.

# Current playable checkpoint — 2026-11-01: mouse controls and quest markers

P2-05 / P2-11 / P2-12 / P3-06 / P3-11 / P3-12 / initial P3-14:
mouse enemy/friendly selection, right-click basic sword/NPC interaction, F and
five ability slots now accompany committed floating quest markers. Standard Bevy
picking/UI, bounded hierarchy/intent handling and static occlusion preserve server
validation. Camera dragging waits for the click threshold and respects UI ownership.
**91 client tests**, formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and
**41 Python tests** pass. **14 final native starts have zero GPU diagnostics**,
including synthetic X11 OS input at 1280×720, 1920×1200 and 3440×1440 fullscreen,
actual OIDC/PostgreSQL/rejoin/restart, mouse melee and travelling-magic regressions.
[Behavior, exact evidence and limits](../PLAYER_CONTROLS.md). Matched source/binaries/art/proof:
`build/world-input-qualified-v1-20261101`. The previous whole-workspace result
remains 608 passes / 40 explicit skips; it is not a new whole-workspace run.
Earlier checkpoints remain preserved. No new FPS/capacity or Windows claim.
Dodge is the next separate authoritative movement slice. Changes remain local;
no commit or push was made.

# Active slice — 2026-11-01: floating quest markers

P3-11 / P3-12 / initial P3-14: standard Bevy guide markers now derive from
committed private quest state, with bounded distance, residency and static
occlusion checks. Four new checks / 86 client tests, formatting and denied-warning
workspace/all-target Clippy pass. Native validation is in progress.
[Behavior, acceptance and current evidence](../QUEST_MARKERS.md). The preserved playable
checkpoint remains `build/projectile-qualified-v1-20261031`. Development resumed
at the user’s request; changes remain local and unpushed.

# Current playable checkpoint — 2026-10-31: travelling magic

P3-06 / initial P5-15: wand-gated homing magic has finite speed/range/lifetime,
static collision and server damage/hit outcomes only at impact. Standard Bevy
shows the travelling bolt. **608 workspace passes / 40 explicit fixture skips in
115 groups**, formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and
**41 Python tests** pass. Real OIDC/PostgreSQL/two-client hit/miss/deflect travel,
legacy melee/miss-feedback and 3440×1440 fullscreen launcher fixture cleanup pass.
All **12 final native starts have zero GPU diagnostics**.
[Behavior, exact evidence, launch and limits](../PROJECTILE_TRAVEL.md).
Matched source/binaries/art/proof: `build/projectile-qualified-v1-20261031`.
No new FPS, Windows, crowd or streaming-capacity claim. Earlier checkpoints remain.
Work stopped at the user's request after this slice; all changes remain local,
uncommitted and unpushed. Remaining requested features stay on the working list.

# Qualified playable checkpoint — 2026-10-31: hit/miss/deflect

P3-06 / initial P4-08: checked server-owned hit/miss/deflect now drives player
direct damage, versioned encrypted outcomes and actual visible Bevy labels.
**589 workspace passes / 40 fixture skips in 114 groups**, formatting,
denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and **41 Python tests** pass.
Real OIDC/PostgreSQL/two-client outcome cases, old melee/grip/life/legacy regressions
and 3440×1440 fullscreen launcher cleanup pass; all **31 final native starts have
zero GPU diagnostics**. [Behavior, evidence, launch and limits](../HIT_OUTCOMES.md).
Matched source/binaries/art/proof: `build/outcomes-qualified-v1-20261031`.
No new FPS, Windows, crowd or streaming-capacity claim. Earlier checkpoints remain.

# Current playable checkpoint — 2026-10-31: player sword melee

P2-12 / P3-06 / P3-08 / initial P3-14: committed sword equipment now gates a 3 m
mobile melee action with authoritative windup, range/life/LOS and queue checks.
Standard Bevy upper-body attacks preserve standing/walking/running locomotion
locally and remotely. Terrain readiness follows actual terrain pipelines rather
than cosmetic compilation. [Behavior, proof, launch command and limits](../PLAYER_MELEE.md).

Final unchanged source: **571 workspace passes / 40 explicit fixture skips in
113 groups**, formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and
**41 Python tests**. Real two-account OIDC/PostgreSQL/native melee, moving grip,
rewarded life/restart/backend-loss and legacy regressions pass; normal launcher
cleanup passes at captured 3440×1440 fullscreen. All 25 final starts record zero
GPU diagnostics. Quiet one-client near-spawn cadence is **711/713 FPS** at
1920×1200/3440×1440: [measurement and limits](../PLAYER_MELEE_PERFORMANCE.md).
Matched source/binaries/art/proof: `build/melee-qualified-v1-20261031`.
Earlier checkpoints remain preserved. No crowd/streaming or Windows claim.
Changes remain local. Hit/miss/deflect resolution is the next small slice.

# Performance follow-up — 2026-10-31

Unchanged pursuit checkpoint: one native client with the combat rig and active
wolf/pursuit records **713 FPS at 1920×1200** and **712 FPS at 3440×1440 fullscreen**
near spawn. Each uses 15 steady one-second windows, 81 resident chunks and no
unloads; external validation is off. [Exact evidence and limits](../CREATURE_PURSUIT_PERFORMANCE.md).
This is not population/streaming capacity. Player sword melee is the next slice.

# Current playable checkpoint — 2026-10-31: enemy perception, pursuit and return

P3-07 / P4-03 / initial P3-08 and P3-14: the opt-in wolf perceives a live player,
runs on checked navigation, attacks within reach, breaks off at its leash,
returns to its captured patrol position and resumes the saved route.
[Behavior, exact native evidence, launch command and limits](../CREATURE_PURSUIT_NATIVE.md).

Final unchanged source: **557 workspace passes / 40 explicit fixture skips in
113 groups**, formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and
**41 Python tests**. Actual two-account OIDC/PostgreSQL/native pursuit passes at
1920×1200; moving sword grip, rewarded life/rejoin/restart/backend-loss and legacy
1280×720 regressions pass. Normal new-bundle launcher cleanup passes all three
modes at captured 3440×1440 fullscreen. All final starts have zero GPU diagnostics.
Matched source/binaries/art/proof: `build/pursuit-qualified-v1-20261031`.
Earlier checkpoints remain preserved. This is one NPC in an eight-player prototype,
not population/streamed-navigation capacity. Public NPC attack timing, player
melee/ranged enemy expansion and native Windows remain open. No standalone FPS
claim is made in this checkpoint. Changes remain local.

# Headless slice qualified — 2026-10-31: perception, chase, melee and return

P3-07 / P4-03: opt-in NPC perception/chase/attack/leash/return now drives real
collision/grounding and resumes saved patrol progress. 89 network unit tests,
workspace denied-warning Clippy, formatting and both content bundles pass.
Actual encrypted two-peer pursuit passes at 30 Hz; controller/lifecycle tests run
at 20/30/60 Hz. [Implemented behavior, exact proof and limits](../CREATURE_PURSUIT.md).
Matched headless source/proof: `build/pursuit-authority-qualified-v1-20261031`.
Native OIDC/PostgreSQL/wolf qualification is in progress. The runnable grip
checkpoint stays preserved. No new whole-workspace, FPS/capacity or Windows claim.

# Active slice — 2026-10-31: pursuit policy qualified, server integration next

P3-07 / P4-03: pure perception/chase/attack/leash/return policy passes 108 core
all-target tests, denied-warning core Clippy and formatting. No gameplay profile
or server creature consumes it yet. [Contract, exact evidence and next gates](../CREATURE_PURSUIT.md).
Matched source/proof: `build/pursuit-policy-qualified-v1-20261031`.
The checked navigation prerequisite and runnable grip checkpoint remain preserved.

# Checked prerequisite — 2026-10-31: bounded creature path worker

P3-07 / P4-03: the reviewed static Landmass query is shared with a dedicated
background worker. One outstanding request, bounded package/routes, exact actor /
target-life / destination-revision matching and stale-result expiry pass.
[Implemented contract, proof and limits](../CREATURE_PATH_WORKER.md).

Final workspace: **539 passes / 40 explicit fixture skips in 112 groups**,
formatting and denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy. The server's normal
dependency graph remains headless; library/engine versions are unchanged.
Matched source/proof: `build/navigation-worker-qualified-v1-20261031`.
No creature consumes dynamic paths yet; perception/chase/leash is next.
The runnable `build/grip-qualified-v1-20261031` remains preserved. No new native,
FPS, population-capacity or Windows claim is made. Changes remain local.

# Current playable checkpoint — 2026-10-31: equipped sword stance and moving grip

P2-09 / P3-08 / initial P3-14: server-owned public appearance now selects standing
SwordIdle on local and remote players. While moving, standard Bevy masks retain
the authored closed grip on eleven right-hand digit joints; the original gait
keeps the wrist, prop socket, arm, torso and legs. Wand replacement and unequip
remove the layer; death retains precedence. [Behavior, proof and limits](../EQUIPPED_PLAYER_STANCE.md).

Final workspace: **537 passes / 40 explicit fixture skips in 111 groups**,
formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and **41 Python tests**.
Actual native local and remote Walk/Run poses match the source closed fingers and
original locomotion on every other sampled target. Two-account OIDC/PostgreSQL
rewarded life/rejoin/restart/backend-loss passes at 1920×1200; legacy rig at
1280×720; focused replacement, unequip and equipped movement at 1920×1200.
Normal launcher cleanup passes all three modes at captured 3440×1440 fullscreen.
All final starts have zero GPU diagnostics. Matched source/binaries/art/proof:
`build/grip-qualified-v1-20261031`. The socket checkpoint remains preserved.
Source art and the failed 5 mm production skin gate are unchanged. Upper-body
combat layers, authored equipped locomotion, public remote-player death and native
Windows remain open. No new FPS/capacity claim is made. Changes remain local.

# Current playable checkpoint — 2026-10-31: authored prop sockets and player death

P1-10 / P2-09 / P3-08 / initial P3-14: the opt-in POLYGON combat conversion
preserves `Prop_L` / `Prop_R`, attaches development equipment to the authored
right-hand socket, and plays the local player's authoritative death once before
restarting animation for a fresh life. Actual two-account OIDC/PostgreSQL/native
gameplay passes at 1920×1200, the legacy rig passes at 1280×720, and normal
launcher cleanup passes all three modes at captured 3440×1440 fullscreen.
[Behavior, exact evidence and limits](../PLAYER_ANIMATION_SOCKETS.md).

Final workspace: **532 passes / 40 explicit fixture skips in 111 groups**,
formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and **41 Python tests**.
All final native starts have zero GPU diagnostics. Exact matched source,
executables, art and proof: `build/sword-qualified-v1-20261031`. The wolf checkpoint
remains preserved. Remote-player death replication, equipped combat stance /
layering, actual sword mesh adoption, the failed 5 mm production skin-fidelity
gate and native Windows remain open. No new FPS or MMO-capacity claim is made.
Changes remain local.

# Current playable checkpoint — 2026-10-31: animated development wolf

P1-10 / P2-08 / P2-09 / initial P3-14: the opt-in MeshTint wolf now follows
existing authority patrol, incoming windup, hit, death and fresh respawn states
through standard Bevy animation. Actual two-account OIDC/PostgreSQL/native gameplay
passes with current and legacy bundles; normal launching passes all three cleanup
modes at captured 3440×1440 fullscreen. [Behavior, qualification and limits](../WOLF_CREATURE.md).

Final workspace: **529 passes / 40 explicit fixture skips in 111 groups**, formatting,
denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and 28 Python tests. Quiet single-client
near-spawn baselines are **719 FPS at 1920×1200** and **720 FPS at 3440×1440
fullscreen**; these are not crowd/streaming-capacity results. Exact source,
executables, art and proof: `build/wolf-qualified-v1-20261031`. Prior checkpoints
remain preserved. Public NPC attack timing, general models, player death animation,
production skin fidelity and native Windows remain open. Changes remain local.

# Current playable checkpoint — 2026-10-31: transient player life and retaliation

P3-04 / P3-07: the opt-in thirteen-profile bundle now has authoritative player
health, first-attacker melee retaliation, dead-input suppression and supported
respawn with fresh life/movement streams. Standard Bevy health and incoming /
death / respawn text pass two-account OIDC/PostgreSQL/native gameplay, rewarded
quests, rejoin, server/database restart and backend-loss checks at 1280×720,
1920×1200 and 3440×1440 fullscreen. Normal launcher cleanup passes all three modes.
[Implemented behavior, exact GPU diagnostics and limits](../PLAYER_LIFE_NATIVE.md).

Final unchanged-source checks: **525 workspace passes / 40 explicit fixture skips
in 111 groups**, formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and
28 Python tests. Exact matched binaries / source / proof:
`build/player-life-qualified-v1-20261031`. Health remains transient; production
combat logout policy, chasing/general threat, death animation and native Windows
remain open. Native validation ran with concurrent compilation; no standalone FPS
or MMO-capacity claim is made. Prior playable checkpoints remain preserved.
Changes stay local; no commits or pushes were made.

# Active development — 2026-10-31: shared life-aware prediction qualified

P3-04 / P3-07: initial/dead/unmatched life states now hold the opt-in shared driver,
clear old input/clock debt and keep completed authority corrections visible.
Actual impaired encrypted UDP resumes authoritative movement after respawn at
20/30/60 Hz. **108 relevant network tests**, formatting and denied-warning
workspace/all-target Clippy pass on unchanged final source. [Behavior and limits](../PLAYER_LIFE_PREDICTION.md).
Exact source/proof: `build/player-life-prediction-qualified-v1-20261031`.
Prior full workspace evidence remains 519 passes / 40 skips, not rerun here.
Normal executable/bundle and Bevy/native adoption remain open. Changes stay local.

# Active development — 2026-10-31: encrypted player-life runtime qualified

P3-04 / P3-07 owner-only health, incoming windup, death and respawn now pass actual
two-peer encrypted UDP at 20/30/60 Hz under delay/loss/reordering. Full workspace:
**519 passed / 40 explicit skips in 111 groups**, formatting and denied-warning
workspace/all-target Clippy on unchanged final source. Five new runtime checks
include one specifically identified server-queue unit test. [Contract, evidence scope and next acceptance](../PLAYER_LIFE_RUNTIME.md).
Exact source/proof: `build/player-life-runtime-qualified-v1-20261031`. Normal
executable/bundle and Bevy/native adoption remain open; new-mode OIDC, SQL health
durability and native rendering are not claimed. The preserved playable checkpoint
remains `build/character-menu-qualified-v1-20261031`. Changes stay local.

# Active development — 2026-10-31: life codec/receive barrier qualified

P3-04 / P3-07: bounded owner-only PL01 frames and life/movement correction gating
pass eight wire tests, 100 core / 76 network-library tests, formatting and denied-
warning workspace/all-target Clippy on unchanged final source. Real completed
World health/death/respawn states round-trip through this codec. [Contract and
remaining adoption gates](../PLAYER_LIFE_PROTOCOL.md). Exact source/proof:
`build/player-life-wire-qualified-v1-20261031`. New-mode Renet publication/client
bridge, executable/bundle and Bevy/native adoption remain open. No new-mode
multiplayer/native result is claimed; prior playable checkpoints stay preserved.
Changes remain local.

# Active development — 2026-10-31: player life/retaliation headless authority qualified

P3-04 / P3-07: the new opt-in World mode now runs checked retaliation, transient
health/death and supported streamed respawn with fresh life/movement streams.
Thirteen new World tests, all 100 core / 75 network-library tests, formatting and
denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy pass on unchanged final source.
[Implemented behavior, ordering and remaining gates](../PLAYER_LIFE_AUTHORITY.md). Source/proof:
`build/player-life-authority-qualified-v1-20261031`. Private wire/client/Bevy and
normal executable/bundle adoption remain open. Normal launching still uses the
preserved playable behavior; no new-mode multiplayer/native claim is made. Prior
checkpoints remain preserved; changes stay local.

# Active development — 2026-10-31: player health/life prerequisite qualified

P3-04 / P3-07: checked transient health, one scheduled respawn and nonzero per-actor
life generation pass eight new tests / 100 total core passes, formatting and denied-
warning workspace/all-target Clippy. Retaliation and damage application both refuse
old lives. [Contract and runtime acceptance](../PLAYER_LIFE.md). Source/proof:
`build/player-life-core-qualified-v1-20261031`. World/transport/Bevy adoption remains
open; the current server still reports configured maximum player health. No new
full-workspace/native result is claimed. Prior playable checkpoints are preserved;
all changes remain local.

# Active development — 2026-10-31: creature retaliation policy prerequisite

P3-07 / P3-04: a bounded immutable recipe and fixed-tick retaliation state machine
now pass eight new tests / 92 total core passes, formatting and denied-warning
workspace/all-target Clippy. [Contract, acceptance and limits](../CREATURE_RETALIATION.md). Source/proof:
`build/retaliation-core-qualified-v1-20261031`. This emits intents only; player
health/death/respawn and runtime/Bevy adoption are next. No new full-workspace or
native result is claimed. Prior playable checkpoints below stay preserved; all
changes remain local.

# Current checkpoint — 2026-10-31: existing-account character menu qualified

P3-03: the console launcher lists existing characters and offers N to create
another below the eight-character cap. A known incompatible-profile refusal returns
to selection without rewriting saves; temporary retirement conflicts keep their
bounded retry. Actual OIDC creation on an existing account, incompatible-to-compatible
menu recovery, two native players, rewarded gameplay and database/server restart
pass at 1920×1200 windowed with zero Vulkan diagnostics. Normal eleven-profile
launcher startup/cleanup passes all three modes. [Contract and proof](../CHARACTER_LAUNCHER_MENU.md).

Thirty focused Python checks, formatting and denied-warning workspace/all-target
Clippy pass. Rust/content/binaries are byte-for-byte unchanged from the previous
476-pass / 40-skip workspace and 30-contract SQL checkpoint; those suites were not
rerun for the five Python-file changes. Matched binaries/source/evidence:
`build/character-menu-qualified-v1-20261031`. This is console workflow; physical
terminal/browser input, a complete Bevy login UI and native Windows remain open.
Changes remain local. Prior checkpoints stay preserved.

# Prior checkpoint — 2026-10-31: character gameplay-profile preflight qualified

P3-03 / P3-02: enabled saved inventory/XP/quest profiles are checked in a read-only
transaction while the Selecting reservation is held, before issuing a game ticket.
Expected content incompatibility returns a clear nonretryable HTTP 409 and leaves
the SQL worker available. Missing optional state remains compatible. No saved data
is initialized, migrated or reseeded by this operation; active-owner checks remain.

Actual OIDC/native/SQL at 1920×1200 windowed passes refusal with no ticket, unchanged
legacy journal data through database/server restart, then fresh rewarded training,
loot/barter/equipment and rejoin. Zero Vulkan diagnostics on Linux RX 7900 XTX/RADV.
The client/core/network/content source is unchanged from the prior three-size
reward checkpoint; a new three-size server test is not claimed.
Final unchanged-source workspace: **476 tests / 40 explicit skips**
in 108 groups. Formatting, denied-warning Clippy, 24 focused Python checks
and 30 actual SQL contracts / 33 commands pass, including cancelled-answer and
bounded-queue preflight tests. [Contract and proof](../CHARACTER_PROFILE_PREFLIGHT.md). Matched binaries,
source, validator and evidence: `build/gameplay-profiles-qualified-v1-20261031`.
All changes remain local. General migrations, complete saved-value validation,
physical OS input and native Windows remain open. Prior checkpoints are preserved.

# Prior checkpoint — 2026-10-31: optional quest completion XP qualified

P3-10 / P3-11 / initial P3-16: the opt-in rewarded training quest now accepts at
the guide, counts three authoritative kills, then commits quest completion,
25 XP and its action receipt atomically. Ready at 75 XP becomes 100 XP / level 2
on the default XP curve. Recovered commands and rejoin/restart never award twice.
Standard Bevy guide controls display the configured reward. Item turn-in grants,
abandonment/repeatables, groups and a complete authored production zone remain open.

Actual two-account OIDC/encrypted/SQL native flows pass at 1280×720 and 1920×1200
windowed (zero Vulkan diagnostics), plus 3440×1440 borderless fullscreen (one
previously documented upstream surface-resize diagnostic per startup). Private
progress, personal loot, barter, equipment, reconnect, database/server restart and
backend-loss checks pass. Current binaries also pass the retained journal-only
native flow. The normal eleven-profile schema-2 launcher passes all three cleanup
modes; schema-1 ten-profile validation identity is preserved. Fresh compatible
characters are required; saved content profiles are never silently migrated.

Final unchanged-source workspace passes **475 tests / 37 explicit skips**
in 107 groups. Formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and
23 focused Python checks pass. Separately retained prerequisites cover 27 actual
SQL contracts / 32 commands and three actual OIDC/ticket/SQL retirement modes.
[Exact scope, prerequisites and proof](../QUEST_TURN_IN_XP.md). Immutable source, matched optimized
binaries, validator and public evidence: `build/quest-turn-in-xp-qualified-v1-20261031`.
Native Windows, physical 4K, physical OS input and MMO population/performance
capacity are not qualified. All changes remain local; no commit/push this session.
Earlier journal-only and automatic checkpoints remain preserved.

# Stopped safely — 2026-10-30: initial persistent training-zone integration qualified

The combined two-account OIDC/encrypted/PostgreSQL native run passes at
1920×1200 on Linux (RX 7900 XTX, RADV/Vulkan). Each character independently
completes three kills, earns XP, claims one reward, barters and equips a distinct
item. Exact bags, hands, progress and latest item receipts survive reconnect and
database/server restart; ownership/replay fencing and backend-loss checks pass.
[Scope, fixture settings and limits](../PERSISTENT_ZONE_INTEGRATION.md).

**441 workspace tests pass / 30 explicit skips**, with unchanged final source.
Formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and nine Python helper tests
pass. Exact source, binaries and proof are preserved in
`build/zone-qualified-v1-20261030`; prior vendor and content checkpoints remain.
This combined flow is qualified at 1920×1200 only; prior vendor checks cover
1280×720 and 3440×1440 separately. Physical OS input, native Windows, 4K and
MMO-scale capacity remain unqualified. Accelerated qualification fixtures do not
change default gameplay balance.

Development is stopped at the user's request; all current repository changes are
prepared for commit and push, including concurrent story/Obsidian edits. Private
conversation exports stay local and ignored. This is initial P3-16 training
integration, not a completed authored production zone. P3-17/18 remain unspecified.
Earlier notes below are historical.

# Active development — 2026-10-30: initial P3-15 offline gameplay validator qualified

The ten-profile development bundle now has an offline validator using the actual
core/runtime schemas. It checks item/NPC/creature references and ability/resource/
status compatibility, bounds file reads/paths and reports deterministic exact-byte
hashes. [Tool, acceptance and limits](../GAMEPLAY_CONTENT_VALIDATION.md). Runtime profile loading stays as
qualified; this manifest is an authoring check, not an authoritative world identity.

**441 workspace tests pass / 30 explicit skips**, with unchanged final source.
Formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy, eight focused tool tests
and eight actual CLI refusal cases pass. Source inputs remain unchanged. Exact
source, tool/test executables, docs and proof: `build/gameplay-content-qualified-v1-20261030`.
All previously qualified vendor/gameplay source files remain byte-identical; the
playable checkpoint remains `build/vendor-qualified-v1-20261030` (actual SQL and
native purchasing at 1280×720, 1920×1200 and 3440×1440). No new runtime/native,
performance or MMO-capacity claim is made for this offline tool.

Next is a bounded P3-16 persistent training-zone integration check combining the
existing initial gameplay systems through login, play, logout and reconnect;
its acceptance still needs implementation/verification. Production authoring UI,
navigation/terrain/assets, general quest acceptance/turn-in and other remaining
systems stay open. P3-17/18 remain unspecified. Changes remain local/uncommitted;
concurrent story edits are untouched. Earlier notes below are historical.

# Active development — 2026-10-30: initial P3-12 live vendor barter qualified

The guide offers one positive-cost barter through the existing shared item
owner/sequence: one Training Token for three Training Stones. Live guide/session/
range checks precede acceptance; accepted queued/executing work survives logout.
The Bevy shop retains displayed offer/revisions and acknowledges committed items.
[Exact current behavior, evidence and limitations](../VENDOR_BARTER_FOUNDATION.md).

**433 workspace tests pass / 30 explicit skips**, with unchanged final source.
Formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy, nine Python helper tests,
twenty actual SQL contracts/twenty-six commands, actual item/reward/vendor retirement
and mixed-launcher cleanup pass. Two actual OIDC/native accounts pass purchases,
own SQL/UI comparison, close, reconnect, database/server restart, distant restore
and backend failure at **1280×720, 1920×1200 and 3440×1440 fullscreen**. Actual
widgets were inspected. Windowed GPU validation is clean; fullscreen records only
one specifically allowed upstream wgpu resize diagnostic per startup. Physical
4K, physical OS input and native Windows remain unqualified.

Exact source, five executed binaries, non-story docs and proof are frozen at
`build/vendor-qualified-v1-20261030`; earlier checkpoints remain preserved. Currency,
selling, stock/buyback, general quest acceptance/turn-in and production NPC/player
lifecycle remain open. No new frame-rate or MMO-population claim is made.
Next is a small P3-15 offline gameplay-content validation slice using the existing
checked schemas. P3-17/18 remain unspecified. Changes remain local/uncommitted;
concurrent story edits are untouched. Earlier notes below are historical.

# Active development — 2026-10-30: P3-12 barter database prerequisite qualified

The positive-cost barter now has an atomic backpack cost/output/receipt transaction
and uses the existing bounded critical worker. Exact latest retries recover without
another charge; superseded/conflicting input rejects. [Exact scope/proof](../VENDOR_BARTER_FOUNDATION.md).

**Twenty actual SQL contracts/twenty-six commands pass**, including three new
purchase contracts: rollback, owner/world/byte binding, shared-revision races,
full-bag recovery, cancelled answers, queue saturation, backend loss and actual
process/database restart. Eight barter/36 core regression tests remain qualified;
core source is unchanged. Workspace check, formatting and denied-warning Clippy
pass. Exact prerequisite source/probe/proof: `build/vendor-store-qualified-v1-20261030`.

Live NPC/range entitlement, accepted item-owner retention, encrypted purchase
commands and shop UI remain open. No native purchase or new full-workspace claim
is made. The prior playable NPC/display remains frozen at
`build/dialogue-qualified-v1-20261030`: 418 workspace passes/27 skips and actual
OIDC/native dialogue at 1280×720, 1920×1200 and 3440×1440. P3-17/18 remain unspecified.
All changes remain local/uncommitted; story edits are untouched. Earlier notes
below are historical.

# Active development — 2026-10-30: initial P3-12 informational dialogue qualified

One noncombat guide now supports private authoritative branches, bounded Renet
requests/acknowledgements and a standard Bevy panel. E talks, F1–F4 or buttons choose,
Esc closes without exiting, and walking away closes the session. Clicks retain the
observed choice/revision. [Exact source/evidence/limits](../NPC_DIALOGUE_FOUNDATION.md).

**418 workspace tests pass / 27 explicit skips**, with unchanged final source.
All seventeen SQL contracts/twenty-three commands separately pass; ten private-asset
cases remain skipped. Formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and
nine helper tests pass. Two actual OIDC accounts/native encrypted clients pass at
**1280×720, 1920×1200 and 3440×1440 fullscreen**: distinct branches, actual Bevy
keyboard/picking, close/reopen/walkaway, fresh sessions after reconnect/database/
server restart, distant restore and backend loss. Informational dialogue creates
no item/reward/XP/objective records. Actual panels were inspected. Windowed GPU
validation is clean; fullscreen has one or two specifically allowed upstream wgpu
resize diagnostics per startup and no other errors. Physical 4K/Windows remain open.

The mixed Scorch/resources/statuses/creature/equipment/reward/XP/objective/dialogue
launcher passes all three cleanup modes. Exact source, three executed binaries,
docs and proof: `build/dialogue-qualified-v1-20261030`. Previous checkpoints stay
preserved. This is the initial informational slice: vendors, quest acceptance/
turn-in, production NPC art, occlusion and real player-death closure remain open.
No new frame-rate or MMO-population claim is made. P3-17/18 remain unspecified.
All changes stay local/uncommitted; story edits are untouched. Earlier notes below
are historical.

# Active development — 2026-10-30: initial P3-11 quest objective slice qualified

One opt-in three-kill objective now uses trusted current-life facts, an atomic
XP/objective transaction, accepted-work retirement, private committed observations
and a standard Bevy journal. Completion grants no extra items or XP.
[Exact behavior, evidence and limits](../QUEST_OBJECTIVES_FOUNDATION.md).

**396 workspace tests pass / 27 explicit skips**, with unchanged final source.
All seventeen actual PostgreSQL contracts/twenty-three commands separately pass;
ten private-asset skips remain skips. Formatting, denied-warning workspace/all-target
Clippy and nine Python helper tests pass. Actual OIDC/encrypted-ticket/SQL lease
checks retain accepted objective work through logout without duplicate credit.

Two actual accounts/native encrypted clients pass at **1920×1200 windowed** and
**3440×1440 fullscreen**: distinct own 1/3 versus 3/3 journals, completion after
XP caps, reconnect, database/server restart, distant restore and backend failure.
Actual widgets were inspected. Windowed GPU validation is clean; fullscreen has
one documented upstream wgpu resize diagnostic per startup and no other errors.
The ordinary 1280×720 mixed Scorch/resources/statuses/equipment/reward/XP/objective
launcher passes all three cleanup modes. Physical 4K and native Windows remain
unqualified. No new performance or MMO population capacity claim is made.

Exact source, four executables, documentation and proofs:
`build/quests-qualified-v1-20261030`. Prior checkpoints remain preserved. Next is
the bounded [P3-12 dialogue foundation](../NPC_DIALOGUE_FOUNDATION.md), currently
plan only. General quest acceptance, dialogue/turn-in rewards and vendors remain
open. P3-17/18 remain unspecified. All changes remain local/uncommitted; concurrent
story edits are untouched. Nothing was pushed. Earlier notes below are historical.

# Active development — 2026-10-30: P3-11 objective core/database prerequisite qualified

One checked development objective and its durable kill receipts now share an
atomic transaction with enabled XP. Completion stays finite; unfinished objectives
can advance after XP caps. Existing XP-only callers retain their own transaction.
[Exact scope and next acceptance](../QUEST_OBJECTIVES_FOUNDATION.md).

Thirty focused core/item tests pass, including five objective tests. All seventeen
actual PostgreSQL contracts/twenty-three commands pass: coupled rollback, old-event
replay, competing recipients, cancelled answers, queue saturation, terminated
backend and actual database/process restart. Formatting, workspace/all-target
check and denied-warning Clippy pass. Exact prerequisite source, probe and proof:
`build/quests-store-qualified-v1-20261030`.

Live quest credit, accepted-work retirement integration, private observations and
the Bevy journal remain open. No new full-workspace or native quest result is
claimed. The qualified P3-10 game/display source and executables remain frozen at
`build/progression-qualified-v1-20261030` (388 tests/24 skips, native 1920×1200 and
3440×1440, 808.60 FPS empty-world baseline). Changes are local/uncommitted; story
edits remain untouched. Earlier notes below are historical.

# Active development — 2026-10-30: initial earned XP and display slice qualified

P3-10's first opt-in slice now connects authoritative fatal-hit facts to atomic
victim-life receipts, committed private XP observations and a standard Bevy
level/bar. Accepted executing/distinct queued XP survives logout and prevents
character reuse until completion. Item pickup and item revisions are independent.
[Exact behavior and limits](../EXPERIENCE_LEVELING_FOUNDATION.md).

**388 workspace tests pass / 24 explicit skips**. All fourteen SQL contracts/twenty
commands separately pass; ten private-asset skips remain skips. Formatting,
denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy, five account-helper tests and four
GPU-policy tests pass. Actual OIDC/encrypted-ticket/SQL retirement proof passes.

Two actual OIDC/native encrypted clients pass kill-to-level, each own UI,
rejoin/database/server restart, distant restore and backend-loss checks at both
**1920×1200 windowed** and **3440×1440 borderless fullscreen**. The normal window
now defaults to 1920×1200; `--window-size` selects dimensions and F11 toggles
fullscreen. Mixed Scorch/resources/equipment/reward/XP launcher checks retain
1280×720 and pass all three cleanup modes. 3840×2160 is accepted configuration;
this 3440×1440 desktop clamps oversized windows, so physical 4K is unqualified.
[Window options and exact display evidence](../DEVELOPMENT_WORLD.md).

Linux RX 7900 XTX / RADV / Mesa 26.2.6 / Vulkan was inspected. Windowed validation
is clean; fullscreen records one specifically documented wgpu resize diagnostic
per startup and rejects other errors. The same release client passes a validation-
off, single-client empty-world tour at **808.60 FPS uncapped, 1920×1200**, with
834 loaded / 753 retired chunks and zero missed server simulation deadlines.
This is not crowded MMO capacity or a native Windows result.

Exact source, binaries and evidence: `build/progression-qualified-v1-20261030`.
Prior reward/core-store checkpoints remain preserved. Next is the bounded
[P3-11 objective foundation](../QUEST_OBJECTIVES_FOUNDATION.md); no quest
code or journal is implemented yet. P3-17/18 remain unspecified. Changes are local/
uncommitted; concurrent story edits are untouched. Nothing was pushed.
Earlier checkpoint notes below are historical.

# Paused — 2026-10-30: P3-10 experience core/database prerequisite qualified

Stopped at the user's request after finishing this prerequisite. Checked progression
profiles, integer level/XP proposals and durable atomic victim-life receipts are
implemented on the existing bounded async worker. Old-event replay returns current
committed progress without another award; cap, rollback, cancelled replies, queue
saturation, competing recipients, backend loss and real restart checks pass.
[Exact scope and remaining acceptance](../EXPERIENCE_LEVELING_FOUNDATION.md).

**25 focused core/item tests pass**, including six progression tests. All fourteen
actual PostgreSQL contracts/twenty qualification commands pass. Formatting,
workspace/all-target checks and denied-warning Clippy pass. Exact source, store
probe and evidence: `build/progression-store-qualified-v1-20261030`.
Live kill-to-XP integration, admission/retirement integration, encrypted XP
observations and Bevy XP UI remain open. No new full-workspace or native XP result
is claimed; this prerequisite does not establish playable progression.

The qualified P3-09 source/executables remain frozen at
`build/rewards-qualified-v1-20261030` (**379 tests / 21 skips**, actual SQL,
native two-account reward/rejoin/restart, ordinary launchers and 805.97 FPS empty-
world baseline). Changes remain local/uncommitted; concurrent story edits are
untouched. Nothing was pushed. Earlier checkpoint notes below are historical.

# Active development — 2026-10-30: initial personal reward slice qualified

P3-09's first opt-in training-kill reward is qualified: authoritative fatal-hit
credit, durable nonrepeatable availability, explicit ordered pickup, atomic items/
consumption/receipt and a standard Bevy widget. Two actual OIDC/native encrypted
clients retain each own items through rejoin, real database/server restart,
distant restore and backend-loss fail-closed behavior. Scorch-to-reward pickup
and ordinary CLI interruption/child-failure/cancelled-login cleanup pass too.
[Exact behavior and limits](../LOOT_REWARDS_FOUNDATION.md).

**379 workspace tests pass / 21 explicit skips**, formatting and denied-warning
workspace/all-target Clippy pass. All eleven SQL contracts/seventeen commands
separately execute successfully, including full-bag retention, rollback and
latest-receipt recovery; ten private-asset skips remain skips. Accepted executing
and distinct queued offers, as well as pickup, retain character ownership through
logout/retirement. The ordinary legacy backpack launcher also passes.

Native screenshots were inspected on Linux RX 7900 XTX / RADV / Mesa 26.2.6,
1280×720, with Vulkan validation. The same release binaries pass an empty-world
one-client movement baseline at **805.97 FPS uncapped**, validation off. This is
not MMO capacity or a native Windows result. Exact source/binaries/evidence:
`build/rewards-qualified-v1-20261030`. Prior equipment/store checkpoints remain
preserved. Changes stay local/uncommitted; story edits remain untouched.

Next is [P3-10 experience and leveling](../EXPERIENCE_LEVELING_FOUNDATION.md):
its proposed small curve, durable kill receipts, retirement and independent own-
character UI contract are documented. No progression code/award/UI is implemented
in the reward checkpoint. Broader loot/groups/instances and production balance
remain separate work; P3-17/18 stay unspecified.

Earlier checkpoint notes below are historical.

# Active development — 2026-10-29: initial status-effect ability qualified

P3-06's first opt-in Scorch slice is qualified: checked definitions, server-owned
periodic damage and refresh, bounded independent sources, source/target cleanup,
encrypted status observations and standard Bevy selected-target indicators.
[Behavior, exact evidence and limitations](../STATUS_EFFECTS_FOUNDATION.md).

**336 workspace tests pass**, with fifteen explicit skips. All five PostgreSQL
contracts separately execute and pass; ten private-asset skips remain skips.
Formatting, workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy and five HTTP helper tests
pass. The standalone server dependency graph remains headless.

Two native encrypted clients pass impaired UDP, Vulkan validation, moving casts,
mana depletion/recovery, 84 periodic hits and four deaths/respawns each, with
protected hit cues under 32,768 cosmetic requests per client. Own/other status
labels and cleared state are visible; screenshots were inspected on Linux
RX 7900 XTX / RADV / Mesa 26.2.5 kisak, 1280×720. Ordinary status/resource/zero-cost
launchers and the actual OIDC/PostgreSQL mixed backpack launcher pass cleanup.
Exact source, binaries and evidence: `build/status-qualified-v1-20261029`.

This is an initial periodic-damage slice, not all of P3-06 or persistent combat.
Player damage/death, healing, dispels, crowd control, class scaling, durable combat
and native Windows remain open. P3-07 creature AI and its minimum P4-03 navigation
prerequisite are now in [offline bake/route prerequisite work](../CREATURE_AI_FOUNDATION.md);
offline central/far saved-terrain packages and headless patrol timing/replication
checks pass; client integration and native qualification are in progress. P3-17/18 stay unspecified. Changes remain local
and concurrent story edits are untouched. Earlier checkpoints below are historical.

# Active development — 2026-10-29: initial durable backpack qualified

P3-05's first opt-in backpack slice is qualified: checked item definitions and
sixteen slots, conserved move/merge/swap/split proposals, durable atomic mutations,
latest-intent recovery and standard Bevy widgets. Neither queue acceptance nor a
client-side proposal is acknowledged as a committed item change.
[Exact behavior, proof and limits](../INVENTORY_FOUNDATION.md).

**322 full workspace tests pass**, with fifteen explicit skips; formatting and
workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy pass. All five PostgreSQL contracts
are separately executed on the final source, including dropped-response recovery,
concurrent conflicts, queue saturation, actual blocked-backend loss and clean
process restart. The other ten skips require private assets. Five HTTP helper tests
pass. Skips are never counted as passes.

Actual OIDC/encrypted-ticket/PostgreSQL lease checks retain both joined and
never-joined characters until accepted item work finishes. An already committed
pose alone cannot release a pending item transaction. Two real native encrypted
clients perform six durable changes and one rejected split each through Bevy
widgets; distinct arrangements match each own character's SQL contents through
rejoin, actual database/authority restart, changed spawn and backend loss.
Screenshots were inspected; Vulkan validation and 4×4 cell-layout checks pass on
Linux RX 7900 XTX / RADV NAVI31 / Mesa 26.2.5 kisak, 1280×720.

`python3 tools/play.py --account-login --inventory` opts in using the configured
local OIDC/PostgreSQL boundary. Press I, select an item then a destination; Split
one changes the next operation. Add `--resources --spell-feedback` to load those
profiles too. The ordinary mixed launcher passes interruption/child failure and
pending-browser cancellation, with owned children/tickets removed and database
ownership closed. Exact source/binaries/evidence:
`build/inventory-qualified-v1-20261029`. Prior resource/admission checkpoints remain
preserved. [Resources and their separate performance proof](../STATS_RESOURCES.md).

This is the first development backpack, not all of P3-05: equipment, instances,
item use/destruction, currency, trade, vendors and rewards remain open. Durable
items do not persist transient vitals/combat or complete the persistent zone.
Production account hardening and native Windows remain open. Next is the scoped
[P3-06 status-effect ability](../STATUS_EFFECTS_FOUNDATION.md); its checked definitions, authoritative timing and encrypted two-client replication
pass focused tests. Native presentation and integrated regression qualification are
in progress. Engineering changes remain local/unpushed and concurrent story
edits are untouched. Earlier checkpoint notes below are historical.

# Current development checkpoint — 2026-10-29: persistence qualified

P3-02's initial ordinary-position persistence slice is qualified against actual
PostgreSQL 16.15. Two native encrypted clients save authoritative checked f64
positions, restart both database and server, reconnect in reversed order and
restore their own positions around 15 km despite a changed default spawn. Stable
character/owner IDs survive; runtime actor/world identity is fresh. Wrong-world
startup rejects before listen, and actual database backend loss fails the session
closed. [Exact behavior and evidence](../PERSISTENCE_FOUNDATION.md).

**284 workspace tests pass**, with 12 explicit skips (ten private fixtures and two
actual-PostgreSQL tests separately executed successfully); formatting and denied-
warning all-target Clippy pass. Native integrated persistence/combat/UI/feedback
passes under impaired UDP with 9,728 cosmetic requests per client and all critical
cues delivered. Launcher interruption/child-failure cleanup closes database
ownership too. The persistence-disabled one-client empty-world baseline passes at
821.84 FPS uncapped, validation off; this does not establish MMO capacity.
Qualified artifacts: `build/persistence-qualified-v1-20261029`.

`python3 tools/play.py --persistence` opts into the development database boundary
using private `THEIA_DATABASE_URL` (numeric loopback only); add `--spell-feedback`
for combat/UI/effects. Ordinary launch still works without database configuration.
This uses trusted development issuer slots, not external accounts. Character
creation/selection, inventory/economy durability, power-loss recovery, process
handoff, native Windows and production database transport remain open. Owned test
clusters/processes stopped and plaintext password files were removed.

Next is P3-01 provider-neutral OIDC, validated against an owned local Keycloak
fixture, as selected by the user. Its initial scope and acceptance checks are in
[AUTHENTICATION_FOUNDATION.md](../AUTHENTICATION_FOUNDATION.md). The provider
fixture has passed discovery and a real authorization-page/PKCE code exchange;
application verification, internal sessions and game admission remain unimplemented.
Production identity-provider selection stays open. Engineering changes remain
local/uncommitted; nothing was pushed and story edits remain untouched.
Earlier checkpoints below are historical.

# Current development checkpoint — 2026-10-29

P2-14's initial action-slot/health/cast/cooldown UI is qualified. Standard Bevy
widgets and the Digit 1 shortcut share the existing bounded cast-request path;
all values come from authoritative health/tick deadlines. Two actual clients pass
impaired encrypted UDP, five pointer presses/five widget requests plus five
keyboard requests each, <0.47 px actual fill-width error and integrated
movement/targeting/damage/death/respawn/critical cues. [Exact evidence](../COMBAT_UI.md).

**280 workspace tests pass**, ten private-fixture skips, denied-warning
workspace/all-target Clippy and formatting. A first full-build Rust linker
segmentation fault is retained; the serial retry completed successfully.
Native critical-only quality, isolated PCM, same-binary ordinary baseline
(832.17 FPS uncapped, one empty-world client, validation off) and real two-client
UI-only/feedback launcher interruption/child-failure cleanup pass. Binaries and
original data are preserved in `build/combat-ui-qualified-v1-20261029`.

Run `python3 tools/play.py --combat` for the clickable slot and bars, or
`--spell-feedback` for the original spatial effects/audio too. Tab selects,
Backspace clears; press the slot or Digit 1 to cast. This is one development slot,
not a production multi-bar editor, full accessibility/responsive UI, player HP,
physical OS input, Windows execution or population-capacity qualification.

P3-02 persistence is now in progress. Actual PostgreSQL store/migration/worker
checks pass, including ownership, stale/invalid writes, transactional rollback,
bounded coalescing and cancellation/backend-loss behavior. The server adapter is
wired; live save/restore acceptance is pending. See `docs/PERSISTENCE_FOUNDATION.md`. No PostgreSQL system service was
installed; the owned test server is stopped. External identity-provider choice
remains open. All changes stay local/uncommitted; story edits remain untouched.
Earlier checkpoints below are historical.

# Current development checkpoint — 2026-10-28

The initial P2-13 spell feedback slice is qualified: original standard Bevy
meshes/materials and spatial audio follow actual encrypted server outcomes,
including damage/death after target retirement. Combat profile 2 binds checked
global cue positions and ability IDs; old combat-profile clients fail admission.
The full workspace run passed **278 tests** (ten private-fixture skips); final
client tests, denied-warning all-target Clippy and formatting also pass.
[Exact native evidence, hashes, prior failure and limits](../SPELL_FEEDBACK.md).

Run `python3 tools/play.py --spell-feedback` (optionally `--clients 2`): Tab selects,
Digit 1 casts, Backspace clears. The normal saved-terrain/prediction launch,
selection-only `--targeting` and UI-only `--combat` remain available; these modes
keep audio disabled. Two native Linux/Vulkan clients passed impaired UDP with
10,240 synthetic cosmetic requests each: all 18 critical cues per client played
and appeared under concurrent cosmetic load, with zero critical overflow/event
gaps/large movement displacements. Peak visuals/voices were 50/26, within 64/32.
Critical-only quality and live visual/audio origin shifts also pass.

Owned isolated audio captures contain actual cue PCM, no foreign streams or
default-sink changes; private sinks were removed. The same-binary one-client empty
baseline passed at 826.78 FPS uncapped with validation off; this is not MMO
capacity. Actual two-client feedback launcher interruption/child-failure cleanup
passed. Binaries/data are preserved in `build/spell-feedback-qualified-v1-20261028`.

Stopped safely after this completed slice at the user's request. Next planned
work is P2-14 clickable action-slot and clearer health/cast presentation; it has
not started. Broader combat/AI/navigation, persistence/rewards, native Windows,
physical keyboard/mouse delivery, production sound design and population scale
remain open. All engineering changes remain local and uncommitted; nothing was
pushed. Story edits were left untouched. Earlier checkpoints below are historical.

# Current development checkpoint — 2026-10-26

Resumed after user commit `9497a18`. The input-agreement diagnostic gate now passes
236 full workspace tests (ten private-fixture skips), denied-warning Clippy/fmt,
actual saved/generated impaired UDP and an uncontended 600-second eight-peer soak.
Both simulation and I/O record zero missed deadlines in the uncontended run;
identity return, bounded terrain residency, diagnostic counts and cleanup pass.
[Input evidence](../PREDICTION_INPUT_DIAGNOSTICS.md), [soak evidence](../SAVED_TERRAIN_SOAK.md).
Severe-link errors up to 1.6085 m remain documented; stopped convergence is not a
smoothness guarantee. Native Windows and MMO population capacity remain open.

P1-11's bounded ability-data prerequisite is now qualified: immutable validated
JSON, mobile-casting defaults, off-GCD options and ceiling simulation-tick timing.
All 16 core tests, workspace/all-target Clippy/fmt and actual offline validation at
20/30/60 Hz pass. [Ability data](../ABILITY_DATA.md). These checks follow the movement
checkpoint; no combined 241-test result is claimed. Live targeting/casts/damage
and the rest of P1-11/P2-11–14 remain open. All new changes stay local.

## Previous checkpoint

# Current checkpoint — stopped safely, 2026-10-26

The user requested stopping. No soak is running; the final diagnostic full-suite
relink was safely interrupted. Changes remain local and uncommitted.

The actual 600-second, eight-peer saved-terrain soak passes identity return,
bounded residency and zero missed simulation deadlines. Separate I/O pump misses
under concurrent builds remain recorded. [Soak evidence](../SAVED_TERRAIN_SOAK.md).
The poor-link test passes movement/convergence at 20/30 Hz and safe suspension
outside the 60 Hz latency window. [Envelope](../PREDICTION_LATENCY.md). That checkpoint
passes 235 workspace tests (ten private-fixture skips), denied-warning Clippy/fmt,
221 asset Python tests and four GLB alignment tests.

The subsequent bounded input-agreement diagnostics are implemented; all 11 focused
history tests and workspace/all-target denied-warning Clippy pass. Their final
full-suite/real-UDP run was interrupted, so these new counters have no completed
runtime qualification. [Diagnostic checkpoint](../PREDICTION_CONTRACT.md). Resume with
that verification before interpreting the remaining correction outliers. No next
feature is active; no native Windows or MMO population capacity is qualified.

Current continuation, 2026-10-23 — P1-10/P2-06/07 and initial P3-13:
[saved continental terrain](../SAVED_TERRAIN.md), with the existing coordinate,
controller, readiness and prediction prerequisites. Acceptance is recorded there;
saved terrain now passes full runtime/default adoption checks. The user resumed work.
The matched-tick/render diagnostics and bounded rate prediction clock also pass
234 Rust tests and native Linux comparisons; [clock evidence](../PREDICTION_CONTRACT.md).
The actual eight-peer, 180-second headless saved-terrain soak passes;
[scope, remaining checks and safe stop](../SAVED_TERRAIN_SOAK.md). Work is stopped
at the user’s request; changes remain local and uncommitted.
Earlier queues/stops below are dated historical context. No region/shard service
or complete P3-13 acceptance is implied.

Current target correction, 2026-10-22: the user adopted a 16 km × 16 km graybox
world with the POLYGON development player. See [scope and evidence](../GRAYBOX_WORLD.md).
This keeps Bevy/Avian/Renet and authoritative movement, freezes forest reproduction,
and introduces bounded procedural terrain residency rather than expanding the old
fixed-frame imported-package experiment to claim continental streaming. Future
persistent terrain remains offline-generated/authored and saved as versioned chunks.

# Active architecture alignment

P1-06/08 and P2-04 continuation, 2026-10-22: completed-step command timing and
the bounded headless reconciliation core now use the qualified shared controller.
Per-actor movement streams are distinct from world incarnations; replay is capped
at 64 steps with explicit readiness/teleport/collision/overflow resets. Scheduled
delivery tests exercise Avian seam/jump correction at 20/30/60 Hz. The actual Renet authority/client now select the explicit prediction profile for
the graybox launcher. Real encrypted impairment, native camera/animation and
teleport/held-jump resets pass; the retained path remains available through
`--no-prediction`. Wider latency/load and native Windows remain unqualified. [Contract](../PREDICTION_CONTRACT.md).

The [shared image continuation](../SHARED_IMAGES.md) implements immutable PNG
dependencies and variant-aware standard Bevy image paths. Actual town extraction
preserves geometry/materials/PNG bytes and leaves shared images outside its new
GLB. This is not terrain partitioning or measured streaming capacity; real graph
pruning, terrain/collision partitioning and measured budgets remain before
default adoption. Current executed qualification is recorded in status.

The [geometry contributor continuation](../CHUNK_CONTRIBUTORS.md) now implements
schema-2 bound package envelopes, complete-cell residency/readiness and actual
collider/Bevy hierarchy checks. Current qualification is separate in status.
Measured embedded images dominate the town package, so shared immutable image
bindings precede real terrain/collision partitioning. The launcher remains
monolithic; this does not establish source-model fidelity or production budgets.

The [paired handover continuation](../CHUNK_HANDOVER.md) implements opt-in authority
lookahead/offers, bounded hidden Bevy preparation, exact retirement barriers,
retained local/remote/recovery coverage and matching live Avian generation
publication. Original-fixture qualification does not establish geometry ownership
for the imported town. The default remains monolithic; contributor geometry,
partitioning and wider content/streaming budgets remain row-5 work.

The [movement-boundary continuation](../CHUNK_BOUNDARIES.md) now constrains input
and gravity projections to authoritative/client coverage, including missing
corners. Support validation/fallback preserves ordinary capsule contacts and
fixes the large-convex-floor regression. Actual paired rendered retirement is
still open; initial chunk startup and the monolithic launcher remain in place.

The 2026-10-20 [readiness continuation](../CHUNK_READINESS.md) adds wire/ALPN 9
acknowledgements bound to the exact accepted report and a fixed simulation tick.
Client confirmation also waits for a post-application snapshot. Rendering remains
initial-only; actual retained presentation, paired replacement and tile ownership
are still row-5 work. See [current qualification](../STATUS.md).

Updated 2026-10-19, Australia/Sydney. The user instructed: “Make all changes needed
to align.” The handoff is now the active target for this repository. This record
supersedes unresolved policy notes in the earlier audit; it does not label future
game features as implemented. Work stays local in `theia-mmo`.

## Resolved direction

- Keep the repository and migrate tested foundations in place. The actual remote
  is `https://github.com/code-studio-au/theia-mmo.git`; the handoff's old engine URL
  is a source-document error, not an implementation destination.
- Renet with authenticated/encrypted `renet_netcode` transport is the initial
  target. Existing Quinn code is the migration baseline. No Renet failure or
  fallback decision has occurred.
- Avian is the initial physics target. Global positions use f64 and local
  rendering/physics frames use bounded f32; the existing tile controller remains
  a compatibility fixture until the runtime migration passes its tests.
- Predominantly static collision replaces the old absolute static-world rule.
  Scripted authoritative elevators/platforms are allowed. Vegetation wind/bending
  is presentation-only unless a gameplay collider is explicitly required. Doors,
  buildings and ordinary props remain static. Character pass-through remains.
- Use the supplied Pn-nn task identifiers, overlapping workstreams and delivery
  gates. Keep P3-17/18 blocked and refine actual prerequisites before each slice.
  Do not resume house-by-house collision authoring as the general solution.

## Qualified schema-3 content/default adoption — 2026-10-20

General static meshes, explicit spawns and zero-spawn chunks pass actual native
mesh/map and chunk lifecycle checks. The launcher defaults to town revision 2;
actual default-launch tests verify ID/revision and cleanup. Zero-delta Avian
refresh and mesh-room camera regressions are fixed. [Scope](../GENERAL_COLLISION.md).
Moving-actor chunk activation, normal residency, skeleton contracts and source
collision fidelity remain open.

## Normal imported-map movement adoption

Normal imported authority now uses the [shared controller](../KINEMATIC_CONTROLLER.md)
with validated cached development spawns, finite-world-only collision barriers,
local body support and observable per-actor recovery. Highest-surface selection
is confined to trusted legacy spawn initialization. The four content/physics
world-boundary walls are not introduced into individual residency chunks.
General collision mesh authoring, explicit spawn metadata and moving-actor/chunk
activation remain open; conservative authored routes stay regression fixtures.

## Shared graybox kinematic controller

[One static-world capsule controller](../KINEMATIC_CONTROLLER.md) now drives
fixed-step graybox authority and offline motion. Actual Avian geometry qualifies
walls, headroom, steps/slopes, stacked floors, falling/jumping and nonblocking
actors. Wire v7 adds held-level jump; authority owns motion state. Imported map
controller migration and live chunk/actor activation remain open. Existing map
routes remain compatibility regressions.

## Actual Bevy chunk publication diagnostic

[The real client diagnostic](../CHUNK_PRESENTATION.md) now consumes bounded
residency with actual GLB scenes, hidden hierarchy staging, retained roots and live
Avian bodies published together. Pixel checks and live BVH/capsule queries qualify
replacement, failed glTF rollback and unload at the origin and distant signed
frames. The normal map remains monolithic. Next is general shared movement and
explicit moving-actor/authority activation before production chunk adoption.

## Bounded chunk-residency precursor

[Original chunk fixtures](../CHUNK_RESIDENCY.md) now exercise actual bounded
package reads and Avian load/unload, checked global ownership/query frames and
protected-owner/corrupt-candidate rollback. The normal tile remains monolithic;
visual descriptors do not count as rendered roots. Next is a bounded standard-
Bevy consumer/publication proof before live adoption and the general controller.

## Versioned content-package continuation

[Bounded package manifests](../CONTENT_PACKAGES.md) now bind stable logical IDs,
revisions and collision/visual bytes in normal map development. The headless
server verifies collision without visual I/O; clients additionally stream visual
verification. Real secure admission rejects a stale package revision. Existing
monolithic map/collision limits remain. Continue with bounded chunk ownership/
residency and general controller contracts; no streaming or general multi-floor
movement is implied by a content fingerprint.

## Bounded scheduler qualification continuation

The [actual Renet scheduler qualifier](../SCHEDULER_QUALIFICATION.md) exercises eight
authenticated peers at 20/30/60 Hz, bounded burst/replay inputs, simulation-time
expiry, a controlled authority executor stall and recovery, and budget removal.
Fixed-memory timing histograms distinguish simulation and pump work. The server
retains its skip policy and prototype capacity. Full-map/render/crowd/soak and
broader action commands remain open; continue with general content/controller
contracts rather than expanding bespoke houses.

## Client render/static-physics rebase continuation

[Client render and Avian rebasing](../FLOATING_ORIGIN.md) now reprojects canonical
scenery roots and actual collider Positions/Transforms in one frame, with stable
global interpolation and converted camera queries. Server query scenes remain
fixed to the bounded fixture. Multi-chunk ownership and dynamic-body rebasing are
not delivered. Earlier fixed-client-anchor notes below record the prior slice.

## Earlier runtime coordinate/identity continuation

[The bounded coordinate/identity migration](../COORDINATES_IDENTITY.md) now uses
checked global authority poses, epoch/origin wire v6 and consistent relative
presentation in both transports. Snapshot wire frames rebase live. Client render
and Avian content anchors remain fixed for the fixture; automatic render/physics
origin shifting, content ownership and general region/entity replication remain
open. Earlier foundation-contract-only descriptions below record previous stages.

## Earlier executable continuation

The user now prioritizes foundations over playability. Follow the
[dependency-based execution order](EXECUTION_ORDER.md). The
[Renet executable bridge](../NETWORKING_RENET.md) now carries real application
sessions with local short-lived tickets and world-checked welcomes; existing wire
v5/local fixture poses are retained. The
[bounded local network qualification](../RENET_QUALIFICATION.md) now passes and
Renet is the launcher default; live coordinates/identity are the next gate. This
does not close the full P1-07/P2-02 task scopes or introduce external account authentication.

## Earlier initial foundation slice

**P1-02/P1-03:** `theia-core` is a renderer- and transport-independent crate with
checked `GlobalPosition`, bounded `LocalPosition`, `LocalFrame`, integer `ChunkId`
and 128 m initial chunk convention. Frame subtraction occurs in f64 before the
f32 conversion. Invalid/out-of-frame positions are rejected rather than clamped.
Rebasing derives local state from global truth. Tests cover positive/negative
billion-metre origins, centimetre offsets, round trips, origin changes and
half-open chunk ownership across negative and positive seams. These are domain
contracts; no large-world client/server pose or streamed terrain integration is
claimed. Region ownership and automatic origin shifting remain later work.

**P1-05/P1-06/P1-12:** simulation supports 20, 30 and 60 Hz, defaulting to 30.
Configuration is locked once actors join or simulation starts. Movement uses
the configured fixed dt; input expiry preserves approximately one third of a
second, rounded up to a whole tick. `TickRate::ticks_for` provides checked
simulation-time duration conversion for future ability timers. Input sampling
remains independently at 30 Hz; rendering stays independent.

The server uses skipped missed deadlines, not an unbounded catch-up burst.
Gameplay time slows if deadlines are missed; skipped wall time does not advance
cooldowns or movement. `TickMetrics` records steps, work duration, lateness and
missed-deadline observations; shutdown emits `simulation_summary`. This is
instrumentation, not loaded scheduler qualification. Full overload/queue-pressure
and adverse-network benchmarking remain open.

Snapshots now carry validated server `tick_hz`. Client movement-speed estimates
and remote interpolation use that rate. Wire and ALPN are version 4; old and new
executables must not be mixed. Existing bounded intents, applied sequence numbers,
authority checks and eight-peer prototype cap are retained.

**P1-07/P1-08:** Renet and `renet_netcode` are pinned at 2.0.0. The transport
contract has separate unreliable movement and prioritized reliable event channels,
8 KiB per-channel queue limits and a 2,400-byte per-update sending budget. Secure
constructors use server-side private keys and signed/encrypted connect tokens;
no unsecure-mode shortcut is exposed by these helpers. Tests use two real UDP
clients against the existing authority, verify replicated movement/acknowledgement,
reliable welcome delivery and disconnect cleanup, and reject a wrong issuer.
Test tokens/keys stay in memory and are not logged or saved.

This is the first transport proof. The desktop launcher still uses Quinn. General
session admission, an external identity provider, short-lived single-use tickets,
ticket replay handling, world handshake, full client migration, rate enforcement,
loss/delay/reorder/reconnect and measured bandwidth acceptance remain unfinished.
The bounded test harness is not the production Renet server implementation.

## Avian runtime migration

The user has adopted the development revision. Avian `0.8.0-dev` is pinned at
`1070759b2145dc078abedace91dc7fe78013a45c` with exact Bevy `0.20.0` and is now active
in the normal client, shared movement queries and headless authority. Published
Avian 0.7 is not used. Standard plugins/colliders, capsule casts and mesh ground
rays replace custom box sweeps and the runtime terrain grid. Renderer features
are confined to the client manifest. Wire/ALPN is now 5.

See [physics migration](../PHYSICS_AVIAN.md) for acceptance evidence and the retained
grounded/profile limitations. A precise all-building importer, general multi-floor
controller, gravity/jumping and prediction remain open. No Rapier fallback occurred.

## Commands and evidence

Normal development launch remains `python3 tools/play.py`. To select another
server rate use `python3 tools/play.py --tick-hz 60`, or run the server directly:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p theia-server -- 127.0.0.1:5000 build/server-cert.der --tick-hz 60
cargo run --release --locked -p theia-network --example simulation_baseline
```

The CPU baseline advances eight synthetic graybox actors and encodes snapshots
for ten simulated seconds at each rate. It does not measure wall-clock scheduling,
live network clients, terrain, rendering or MMO capacity. One **pre-Avian** release run produced:

| Hz | Steps | p50 step+encode | p95 | Maximum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | 200 | 1,613 ns | 1,774 ns | 7,505 ns |
| 30 | 300 | 1,553 ns | 1,803 ns | 4,128 ns |
| 60 | 600 | 1,613 ns | 1,724 ns | 43,403 ns |

Recorded on AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D; the concurrent native rendering qualification
can affect timings. Raw results are local in `build/alignment-baseline.jsonl`.

The first foundation run passed formatting, denied-warning Clippy, tests and build.
That pre-Avian run had 51 Rust tests: 19 client, 5 core, 17 network unit, 8 QUIC loopback and
2 Renet loopback. Python checks pass: 31 asset tests plus 4 GLB repair tests.
The earlier audit's dependency blockers were resolved using the existing ignored
SDK and asset-tool environment, without system installation:

```sh
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PWD/build/native-sdk/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig" \
LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/build/native-sdk/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu" \
  cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
# Use the same environment for cargo test/build --locked --workspace.
build/asset-tools/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tools/asset_tests
build/asset-tools/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tools -p test_align_glb.py
```

Native integration results are recorded in [VALIDATION](../VALIDATION.md).
Native Windows execution and MMO-scale capacity remain unqualified.

## Next acceptance gates

The [foundation execution order](EXECUTION_ORDER.md) refines these dependencies.
The [real Renet bridge](../NETWORKING_RENET.md) now connects the applications by
default after local qualification; Quinn remains an explicit regression option.

1. Complete coordinate/identity/collision/content contracts and integrate global
   truth/local frames into authority, replication and presentation coherently.
2. The bounded local Renet replacement gate now passes; the launcher defaults to
   Renet. Retain explicit Quinn regressions and qualify future production admission,
   broader security and loaded networking separately.
3. Qualify general collision authoring/explicit spawns and live chunk/actor
   activation using shared movement; preserve authored route regressions.
4. Add prediction/reconciliation, then the first data-driven two-player combat
   loop. Expand terrain streaming/navigation and persistence through their actual
   dependencies rather than scaffolding all six phases upfront.

See [live task status](TASK_STATUS.md). Architectural adoption is complete;
implementation of the full MMO roadmap is not.

## Moving-actor authority activation continuation — 2026-10-20

[Bounded authority activation](../CHUNK_ACTIVATION.md) now connects residency to
actual fixed-step actors and the real secure Renet loop. Publication revalidates
current footprints/support/clearance and epoch/generation, retaining active state
on failure. One owner-side transaction prepares collision off-tick; unknown
neighbors hold horizontal motion while preserving jump/gravity. Original Avian
fixtures and actual two-client secure UDP checks pass. Normal development map
selection remains monolithic. Continue row 5 with paired Bevy/authority residency
and actual tile ownership/partitioning; prediction follows that acceptance gate.

## Shared normal initial chunk startup — 2026-10-20

[The shared startup descriptor](../CHUNK_STARTUP.md) now connects normal executable
server/client startup, trusted global spawns, initial standard GLB scenes, live
Avian/camera and actual encrypted sessions. Client and server query frames may
differ without changing physical content; the initial selection is bound in the
version-2 session fingerprint to reject mismatched initial-only clients. Normal
loading remains initial-only and the launcher remains the monolithic town. Next:
paired dynamic readiness/publication, then actual tile geometry ownership and
partitioning with measured budgets. Do not infer complete streaming from these
bounded original fixtures or move to prediction before the row-5 adoption gate.


## Offline actual-world partition continuation — 2026-10-20

P1-10/P2-06/P2-07/P2-08, row 5: actual terrain/collision clipping, whole model
ownership and per-package graph pruning now have independent source comparisons.
The town produces 26 packages; all 2,532 model mesh instances and original
transforms/buffers/materials remain, with terrain UV/height/winding and collision
surface/box checks. Each actual package passes the Rust verifier. Generated
original partition output also passes two actual two-client Bevy/Avian cases,
including signed distant/independent frames and delayed publication.
[Contract and measured budgets](../WORLD_PARTITIONING.md).

The town needs nine providers per cell and ten initially, so only a candidate
index is emitted under the four-package proof budget. This closes the offline
partition slice, not actual-town runtime adoption or a whole task. Next: measure
combined actor/lookahead/recovery/staging demand and resource costs, qualify an
appropriate bounded runtime budget and world-edge policy, remaining handover
lifecycle cases, then real town publication/map regressions before default
adoption. Keep prediction behind the relevant row-5 gate. Current checks and
limitations remain separate in [validation](../VALIDATION.md).


## Verified content-budget analysis — 2026-10-20

P1-03/P1-10/P2-06/P2-07/P2-08: source-verified recovery, actual package/image
costs and conservative actor footprint/lookahead unions now have executable
offline analysis. Town union maxima are 18/22/26 packages for one/two/up-to-eight
actors including recovery. All-indexed content has 4,001 static colliders and
1,514,491,904 estimated base RGBA8 bytes; these are not measured live allocations.
A 32-package hard ceiling / 26-package town budget is proposed with concrete
protocol/admission/world-edge/staging/native acceptance in
[the budget contract](../CHUNK_BUDGETS.md). Runtime remains limited to four;
actual town adoption, full task/phase completion and Windows/MMO capacity remain
open. Continue the runtime gate in execution order, retaining map regressions.


## Qualified bounded runtime capacity — 2026-10-20

P1-03/P1-06/P1-08/P1-10/P2-06/P2-07/P2-08 now qualify a 32-package hard
ceiling, unchanged smaller session budgets, checked control addresses,
budget-bound admission identity v3 and wire/ALPN 11. Actual secure UDP carries
full sets; disk/Avian tests protect the 33rd unloaded cell. The opt-in private
town authority loads ten packages then publishes all 26 against a live actor.
Eight actual two-client native cases qualify 32 initial roots, six-provider
delayed publication, independent negative frames, failed-image retention and
normal map/Quinn regressions. [Contract and evidence](../CHUNK_CAPACITY.md).

Continue row 5 with explicit finite-world bounds and edge/corner qualification,
then actual-town client loading/memory/staging measurements and remaining
reversal/supersession/asymmetric-failure checks before promotion. Preserve the
monolithic default at 30 Hz. Native Windows, full task/phase completion and MMO
capacity remain open. New Unity/Synty asset inspection can proceed independently
without changing the adopted runtime architecture or promoting an unqualified map.

## Isolated Elven source import checkpoint — 2026-10-20

P1-10/P2-08 now have hash-bound Unity metadata/dependency inspection and one
source-preserving static geometry/palette preview through standard Bevy GLB
loading. Full-scene prefab mapping and materials remain explicit gates; this
introduces no Unity runtime or custom renderer. [Scope](../SYNTY_ELVEN_IMPORT.md).
Core world-edge, actual-town resources and remaining handover work stay open.

The Elven model-identity continuation now checks source-derived/explicit metadata
IDs against serialized references and reports missing payloads. Source pointers
are not assets: 30 FBXs/two PNGs in this package are LFS text, with 27 reachable
from the demo. This leaves the full-scene import gate open; core foundation work
remains available. No Unity runtime/custom renderer or runtime pin change follows.

## Explicit finite chunk-world bounds — 2026-10-20

Schema-2 startup rectangles now bind checked global gameplay limits separately
from package/contributor extents. Conservative local sweeps share the existing
controller, preserve vertical motion/internal seams and bound lookahead. Schema-1
identities remain unchanged; finite worlds use identity v4 with wire/ALPN 11.
[Contract and evidence](../WORLD_EDGES.md). Actual-town client resources and
remaining handover lifecycle/adoption gates stay open; no phase is complete.

## Actual-town standard client/resource evidence — 2026-10-20

Actual partitioned town startup now loads ten or all 26 standard GLB roots in
two encrypted Bevy clients, with bound shared images and matching live Avian.
Offline conservative AABB envelopes now match the unchanged runtime validator;
new metadata leaves packages/images intact. Linux RSS/PSS and deduplicated DRM
counters are measured with explicit scope. [Evidence](../TOWN_CLIENT_RESOURCES.md).
This retains the adopted standard renderer/asset path. Live candidate/staging
resource qualification and remaining handover gates stay open before adoption.

Actual-town live-publication continuation (row 5, P1-10/P1-12/P2-06/07/08):
shared startup preparation now exposes authority-resolved recovery feet, and exact
round-trip JSON parsing protects admission identity for decimal source heights.
Bounded Bevy lifecycle traces and synchronized two-client captures support source
primitive, retained-root/image and rejected-candidate cleanup checks.
See [the contract and qualification scope](../TOWN_LIVE_PUBLICATION.md).
Broader handover lifecycle checks and default adoption remain open.

Environment-source steering, 2026-10-20: the user selected
[Enchanted Forest](../SYNTY_ENCHANTED_FOREST_IMPORT.md) instead of Elven Realm.
Forest conversion/qualification is the active asset branch; do not wait for Elven
LFS recovery. Preserve town regressions until forest adoption passes.

Forest P1-10/P2-08 continuation: reusable opaque Standard material adaptation
and one actual ruins prefab now pass independent geometry/pixel/material checks
and native Bevy Vulkan inspection. Full scene/foliage/hierarchy/collision gates
remain; see [qualification](../SYNTY_ENCHANTED_FOREST_IMPORT.md).

Forest P1-10/P2-08 source-placement continuation now resolves ordinary prefab
hierarchy/overrides/LOD selection with independently checked emitted source
matrices. Four FBX-backed variants, effects, geometry axes, custom materials and
assembled-scene/collision acceptance remain open.
[Scope and evidence](../UNITY_STATIC_PLACEMENTS.md).

Forest P1-10/P2-08 basic-foliage continuation qualifies real tree/vine cards
through source-derived masked standard PBR, independent pixels/geometry and two
native captures. Explicit preview LOD selection preserves the entire default
highest-detail scene plan. Full vegetation, custom normals, geometry coordinates
and assembled scene/collision adoption remain open. [Scope](../FOREST_FOLIAGE.md).

Forest P1-10/P2-08 model-variant continuation now resolves the four branch
variants through checked inherited aliases and complete authored root TRS. All
179 placements pass independent completeness/binding/matrix checks; old records
are unchanged. Geometry/importer coordinates, full materials and assembled
scene/collision adoption remain open. [Evidence](../UNITY_MODEL_VARIANTS.md).


Forest P1-10/P2-08 geometry continuation: independent mesh-local calibration
matches 52/54 source LOD bounds with two explicit centre mismatches. A shared
standard-glTF assembler preserves shear and mirrored winding; five authored ruins
placements and an asymmetric fixture pass native Bevy/Vulkan checks. Binary
TerrainData, full vegetation, assembled-scene/collision/multiplayer adoption
remain open; preserve town regressions. [Contract](../UNITY_GEOMETRY.md).


Forest P1-10/P2-06/P2-07/P2-08 terrain prerequisite now preserves all 263,169
binary source height samples, five control/layer bindings and 1,365 patch extrema.
Full-grid ground and ground-plus-five-ruins render in native Bevy; the finite
colour bake/geometric normals remain explicit approximations. Partition matching
collision under current budgets, complete full vegetation/source assembly and
qualify multiplayer before adoption. [Contract](../UNITY_TERRAIN.md).


Forest P1-10/P2-06/P2-07/P2-08 ground collision continuation now qualifies four
full-sample packages, independent complete source coverage, real Avian probes/
seam/jump checks and two encrypted native two-client cases. An opt-in launcher
loads the ground; the default town and old map routes remain qualified. Complete
vegetation/materials, authored object collision and representation/budget review
still precede forest adoption. [Contract](../FOREST_TERRAIN_COLLISION.md).


Forest P1-10/P2-08 highest-detail foliage continuation qualifies a static full-
shader PBR profile, actual tree/fern geometry/normal/cutout checks and three native
cases. Three trees and 612 exact-binding ferns now join the visual subset; eight
of twelve used full-shader property profiles are eligible, four remain explicit.
Batch remaining mesh/material overrides and shader families, then complete scene/
collision/resource/multiplayer acceptance before adoption. [Scope](../FULL_FOREST_FOLIAGE.md).


Forest P1-10/P2-08 bulk foliage continuation now qualifies 15,156 source draws in
46 exact mesh/material bindings, actual scene overrides and a shared-image visual
assembly. Independent complete source/category/material/tangent checks and two
native Bevy/Vulkan views pass; 3,503 draws retain explicit unresolved reasons.
Continue remaining Standard/other shader families and mixed slots, then review
object collision and resource budgets before full multiplayer/default adoption.
Town and opt-in forest-ground remain available. [Evidence](../FOREST_FOLIAGE_BATCH.md).


Forest P1-10/P2-08 Standard-material continuation qualifies another 66 bindings /
2,744 source draws, bringing the static subset to 17,900 draws with 31 shared
image variants. Canonical mesh-local export excludes imported FBX node placement;
source normal directions, exact palettes, full scene poses and two native Bevy/
Vulkan views qualify. 759 draws remain explicit. Continue four model variants,
other shader families/mixed slots, then object collision and resource/multiplayer
acceptance before adoption. [Evidence](../FOREST_STATIC_BATCH.md).


Forest P1-10/P2-08 canonical model-variant continuation now qualifies all four
branch models / 179 poses, with inherited IDs, raw nested/outer material bindings,
independent ufbx/source geometry and byte-preserved prior content. The combined
18,079-draw scene passes complete source and native Bevy/Vulkan checks. 580 draws
remain explicit; continue triplanar cliffs/rocks and other shader/mixed-slot work,
then object collision and resource/multiplayer acceptance before adoption.
[Contract](../FOREST_VARIANT_GEOMETRY.md). The user queues the new Elven Realms
folder under Downloads / Synty / Biomes only after forest completion; its contents
have not yet been verified.


Forest P1-10/P2-08/P2-10 triplanar prerequisite now has a source-hash-bound world
projection profile and opt-in Bevy StandardMaterial extension. Actual canonical/
transformed mesh cases pass native lit/diagnostic rendering and independent GPU
pixel checks. The main subset remains 18,079 draws with 580 unresolved. Before
batch adoption, calibrate the exposed FBX mesh/root-pivot offset (including existing
LOD-bound evidence), then integrate multiple profiles, f64 rebase texture phases,
resources/mips and complete scene/object collision acceptance. No automatic mesh
centering or default-map change. [Contract](../FOREST_TRIPLANAR.md). Elven folder
inspection remains queued after forest completion.

Forest P1-10/P2-08 importer checkpoint: actual Linux Unity 6000.6.6f1 compilation/
export and independent recorded-frame point sets pass for all 112 scene FBXs /
214 meshes, with original metadata unchanged. Thirteen existing batch draws need
frame correction. All jobs are terminal; the user requested a safe stop before
converter changes. Resume with source-bound frame adaptation and independent/
native replacement checks, then remaining material/collision/resource gates.
[Findings and acceptance](../FOREST_UNITY_REFERENCE.md).

Resumed 2026-10-21: P1-10/P2-08 now applies recorded Unity mesh frames to ten
bindings / thirteen placements while retaining 106 prototype/placement pairs.
All 116 prototypes and complete rebuilt scene pass source/native checks; town/
farmhouse regressions remain. Corrected moss/all-85 source poses pass as a
standalone single-profile material group, not main-scene adoption. Continue
multi-profile/rebased texture phase/resources/mips, remaining materials, then
object collision/runtime gates. [Evidence](../FOREST_MESH_FRAMES.md).

P1-10/P2-08/P2-10 catalog continuation now qualifies actual mixed Standard and
two-profile rendering, shared typed image handles, complete source composition,
negative mappings and per-profile pixel samples. Legacy and map regressions pass
on the final client. Continue eligible binding batches/full-scene composition,
then rebased texture phase/resources/mips and remaining material/collision/runtime
gates. [Evidence](../FOREST_MATERIAL_CATALOG.md). Main subset counts are unchanged.

## Forest triplanar batch continuation — 2026-10-21

Forest triplanar batch continuation, 2026-10-21: seventeen new bindings / 518
placements now join the corrected visual subset: **18,597 source draws / 62
unresolved**. Fresh independent source/Editor/placement and full composition checks,
four combined native Vulkan views, three dirt-profile modes and 304 pixel checks
pass. Three profiles share eight extension images; 31 Standard image variants
remain distinct. Khronos: 35 files, zero errors, seven runtime-tangent warnings.
Fresh fmt, denied-warning Clippy and 173 Python tests pass. Runtime binaries stay
unchanged; collision/rebase/mips/resource and adoption gates remain. Next: actual
Editor sampler defaults for ten grass draws. All work stays local.
[Evidence and limits](../FOREST_TRIPLANAR_BATCH.md).


## Forest texture-default continuation — 2026-10-21

Forest texture-default continuation, 2026-10-21: actual Linux Unity 6000.6.6f1
resolves four Grass/Mud textures to bilinear/repeat with original PNGs/metadata
unchanged. The ten grass draws now join the qualified subset: **18,607 source
draws / 52 unresolved**. Fresh eighteen-binding source/Editor/placement checks,
four combined native Vulkan views, three grass modes and 274 pixel checks pass.
Fresh fmt, denied-warning Clippy and 175 Python tests pass. Runtime binaries remain
unchanged. Next: independent leaf-colour UV tiling for seventeen giant-tree draws;
remaining materials, rebase/mips/resources, collision and adoption remain open.
All work stays local. [Evidence](../FOREST_TEXTURE_DEFAULTS.md).


## Forest colour-UV continuation — 2026-10-21

Forest colour-UV continuation, 2026-10-21: two exact giant-tree bindings /
seventeen placements now join the qualified visual subset: **18,624 source draws /
35 unresolved**. A second standard glTF channel preserves leaf colour tiling while
normal/AO retain UV0. Source/Editor/exact-placement/full composition checks and six
native Vulkan cases pass; actual loaded materials select the expected channels.
Legacy rendering and encrypted town/farmhouse regressions pass on the new client.
Fresh fmt, denied-warning Clippy, 35 client Rust and 179 Python tests pass. Remaining
materials, rebase/resources/mips/lighting, collision and adoption stay open. All work
is local. [Evidence](../FOREST_COLOUR_UV.md).

## Forest glass continuation — 2026-10-21

Forest glass continuation, 2026-10-21: an explicit untextured Standard-to-glTF
BLEND adaptation adds the lantern glass: **18,625 source draws / 34 unresolved**.
Source geometry/material, actual Editor frame, exact placement/full composition
and four native Vulkan cases pass. The adaptation records Unity premultiplied
lighting/colour-space differences; no runtime shader/binary change is introduced.
Fresh fmt, denied-warning Clippy and 181 Python tests pass. Next: actual mixed
submesh-slot coverage for 25 crystal/geode draws. Remaining materials, lighting,
rebase/resources/mips, collision and adoption remain open. All work stays local.
[Evidence](../FOREST_GLASS.md).

## Forest mixed-material continuation — 2026-10-21

Forest mixed-material continuation, 2026-10-21: nine crystal/geode bindings /
25 draws join the qualified subset: **18,650 source draws / nine unresolved**.
Actual Editor submesh triangles prove source-slot fidelity; four differing quad
diagonals use Editor topology with original corner normals/UVs. Crystal appearance
is an explicit static standard-PBR preview, with refraction/view effects omitted.
Full composition, nine native Vulkan cases, five rebound faults and 19 Khronos
files pass (zero errors/seven retained warnings). Fresh fmt, denied-warning Clippy
and 189 Python tests pass. Water/sky/emissive willow, lighting, rebase/resources/mips,
collision and adoption remain open. All work stays local.
[Evidence](../FOREST_MIXED_MATERIALS.md).

## Forest source sky — 2026-10-21

Forest sky continuation, 2026-10-21: the source skydome now joins the qualified
subset: **18,651 source draws / eight unresolved**. Actual Editor geometry, source
world-height gradient and placement pass independent checks. Standard unlit and
explicit Bevy shadow markers pass four native Vulkan cases; three legacy modes,
two native failure paths and encrypted town/farmhouse regressions pass. Fresh fmt,
denied-warning Clippy, 38 client Rust and 193 Python tests pass. Three Khronos
files have zero errors/seven retained warnings. Seven water draws and one emissive
willow remain, followed by lighting, rebase/resources/mips, collision and adoption.
All work stays local. [Evidence](../FOREST_SKY.md).

## Forest static water — 2026-10-21

Forest water continuation, 2026-10-21: four bindings / seven source water draws
join the qualified visual subset: **18,658 source draws / one unresolved**. Actual
Linux Unity proves built-in Plane identity/geometry; exact Editor FBX triangles,
raw source poses and explicit static PBR factors pass independent checks. Full
composition, eleven native Vulkan cases and four rehashed faults pass. Ten Khronos
files have zero errors/seven retained warnings. Fresh fmt, denied-warning Clippy
and 197 Python tests pass; runtime binaries remain unchanged. Emissive willow,
source water effects, lighting, rebase/resources/mips, collision and adoption remain
open. All work stays local. [Evidence](../FOREST_WATER.md).

## Forest emissive/static coverage — 2026-10-21

Forest emissive continuation, 2026-10-21: the willow completes **18,659 planned
static source draws / zero unresolved static draws**. Source mask HDR emission
uses standard glTF strength 2.6 with an explicit base-floor preview omitting spatial
colour noise. Exact source/Editor geometry, full composition, seven native Vulkan
cases, four rehashed faults and encrypted town/farmhouse regressions pass. Fresh
fmt, denied-warning Clippy, 38 client Rust and 201 Python tests pass; four Khronos
files have zero errors/seven retained warnings. Source effects/particles, lighting,
resources/rebase/mips, object collision and normal map adoption remain open. Next:
qualify shared images against the measured duplicate-image inventory. All work
stays local. [Evidence](../FOREST_EMISSIVE.md).

## Forest shared image resources — 2026-10-21

Forest resource continuation, 2026-10-21: the complete static scene now shares
**37 actual core image handles instead of 77** across 298 slots. Loaded CPU Image
payloads reduce 3,124,764,672 → 1,421,877,248 bytes; both paired native views are
pixel-identical outside the HUD. Complete 944-accessor/material/PNG/role/sampler
checks, four rehashed faults and three legacy modes pass. Fresh fmt, denied-warning
Clippy, 38 client Rust and 202 Python tests pass; Khronos has zero errors/seven
retained warnings. All 18,659 static source draws remain covered. This is inspector
sharing; package admission stays unchanged. Lighting, authored collision, rebase/
mips and runtime adoption remain open. All work stays local.
[Evidence](../FOREST_RESOURCES.md).

## Forest source lighting boundary — 2026-10-21

Forest lighting continuation, 2026-10-21: actual Unity imports qualify source
renderer layers and cookie alpha; all 26 offline source lights are preserved.
Native pixels expose unsupported selective receiver masks and a disabled cookie
feature. The client enables standard Bevy light textures and rejects selective
masks; a separately verified inspector copy explicitly omits three masked suns,
retaining 22 point lights, one spotlight, ambient and fog. Two full-scene and two
cookie GPU cases, three legacy modes, three failure paths and encrypted town/
farmhouse regressions pass. Four rehashed faults reject. Fresh fmt, denied-warning
Clippy, 41 client Rust and 204 Python tests pass. This is an explicit lighting
approximation; selective suns, authored collision, rebase/mips and normal forest
adoption remain open. Next: source collider geometry and measured package capacity.
All work stays local. [Evidence](../FOREST_LIGHTING.md).

## Forest authored collision reference — 2026-10-21

Forest authored-collision reference, 2026-10-21: actual Linux Unity now covers
all 79 raw prefab mesh references, including 39 new collision FBXs and 17 exact
serialized meshes. The actual scene and independent raw hierarchy agree on all
2,776 collider components, with 2,763 active/enabled and maximum matrix difference
0.046 mm. Native targeted rays provide 16,578 reference cases. Four rebound
pose/mesh/state/capsule faults reject; 213 Python tests pass. The invisible downward
water collider, nonuniform primitives, mirrored/sheared meshes and full terrain
budgets remain explicit constraints. Next: native Avian object-query comparison
and measured representation/capacity. Runtime object admission and forest adoption
remain open. All work stays local. [Evidence](../FOREST_COLLIDER_REFERENCE.md).

## Forest Avian source geometry — 2026-10-21

Forest Avian geometry continuation, 2026-10-21: a real headless Bevy/Avian
world matches 2,762 active source object colliders across 16,572 targeted rays,
maximum distance difference 0.27 mm. A float64 source-surface oracle separately
proves all 17 convex inputs are closed hulls. Four rehashed expected-hit/distance/
normal/mesh faults reject in actual Avian. Strict Unity ray equality remains a
recorded diagnostic failure because cooking, backfaces and sheared-mesh behaviour
differ; it is not promoted as parity. Fresh format/diff checks, denied-warning
workspace/all-target Clippy and 215 Python tests pass. Terrain, package budgets,
water policy, movement/camera and forest adoption remain separate gates. Next:
measure the source representation against existing runtime package limits. All
work stays local. [Evidence](../FOREST_COLLISION_GEOMETRY.md).

## Forest full-sample heightfield prerequisite — 2026-10-21

Forest heightfield continuation, 2026-10-21: standard Avian full/adjoining
heightfields retain every source sample and oriented triangle surface. All
2,362,371 source-vertex/centroid queries and 54 capsule seam route runs at 20/30/60
Hz pass against retained triangle packages; maximum heightfield error is 7.16
micrometres. Rectangular axis/diagonal checks pass; two rehashed sample/scale faults
reject. Fresh fmt, denied-warning workspace/all-target Clippy and 217 Python tests
pass. Offline collision-only layout measures at most 47,245 pooled input triangles,
259,623 instantiated triangles, 66,049 height samples per provider and eight
contributors per finite terrain cell. These are not runtime capacity/publication
claims. Next: bounded versioned shape/heightfield admission; existing packages and
defaults remain preserved. All work stays local. [Evidence](../FOREST_HEIGHTFIELDS.md).

## Bounded static-shape admission — 2026-10-21

Static-shape admission continuation, 2026-10-21: collision schema 4 now uses
standard Avian shared mesh inputs, oriented boxes, capsules and full-sample fields
through the normal package/client/server paths. Complete source binding covers
1,731,286 mesh vertices and 263,169 unique heights; all 804,029 source object/
terrain rays pass. Four actual Avian faults and five independent geometry faults
reject. Original encrypted two-client, ±128-billion-metre contributor, town and
farmhouse cases pass on Linux RX 7900 XTX with Vulkan validation. Fresh format,
denied-warning Clippy, complete default network suite, 41 client and 226 Python
tests pass. Existing budgets/defaults remain preserved. Forest visual/material
publication, rebase/resources, water policy and actual-map adoption remain open.
All work stays local. [Contract and evidence](../STATIC_SHAPES.md).

## Forest complete reference packaging — 2026-10-21

Forest package continuation, 2026-10-21: ten source-preserving candidate packages
retain all 18,660 draws, 18,925 primitive instances, 6,137,378 triangles and complete
object/full-sample collision, with at most eight cell contributors. Independent
stream/pose/material/collision checks and four rebound faults pass; actual package
loading plus all 804,029 source rays pass. Ten Khronos files have zero errors and
22 retained generated-tangent warnings. Standard unlit/HDR-emissive shared-image
admission also passes native encrypted material/town/farmhouse cases, ten semantic
faults, the complete default network suite and 41 client tests. Fresh fmt/diff,
denied-warning Clippy and 227 Python tests pass. No forest session/default is
published; custom material rebasing/admission, flags/lighting, resources/mips,
water and actual map movement/camera remain open. All work stays local.
[Packages](../FOREST_SHAPE_PACKAGES.md), [standard materials](../STATIC_MATERIALS.md).

## Forest source texture phase — 2026-10-21

Forest texture-phase continuation, 2026-10-21: the standard Bevy material
extension now accepts a bounded source translation and uploads only its periodic
texture phase. Fifteen native Vulkan views pass: 1,056 independent source-pixel
checks, nine paired colour/normal/lit cases with at most one RGB8 level difference,
a deliberately wrong origin rejected, and both complete forest views pixel-exact
outside HUD. Three translated GLBs have zero Khronos errors/warnings. Fresh fmt/
diff, denied-warning Clippy, 42 client and 218 asset Python tests pass. This is
bounded inspection qualification; normal-world automatic frame updates and bound
runtime material/image admission remain next, followed by flags/lighting,
resources/mips, water and actual-map movement/camera/adoption. All work stays local.
[Evidence and scope](../TRIPLANAR_PHASE.md).

## Bound runtime projection materials — 2026-10-21

Forest runtime-material continuation, 2026-10-21: package schema 3 now binds
self-contained projection parameters, global f64 source anchors and canonical
PNG dependencies; a saved older reader rejects it before startup. The normal
client gates root readiness, shares actual materials/images and updates bounded
phase uniforms with live render rebasing. Six encrypted two-client fixture views
at ±128 billion metres pass, including 828 independent source pixels (colour ≤1
RGB8 level, normals exact). Five native failure paths, fresh town/farmhouse and
three retained handover cases pass. Position-based gait diagnostics preserve the
existing movement/animation acceptance checks. Complete default network tests,
44 client tests, 221 asset Python tests, fresh fmt/diff and denied-warning Clippy
pass. This qualifies the original runtime slice; forest embedding, actual forest
resources/rebase, flags/lighting/mips, water and movement/camera/adoption remain
open. All work stays local. [Contract and evidence](../RUNTIME_MATERIALS.md).

## Complete forest runtime candidate — 2026-10-21

Forest normal-runtime continuation, 2026-10-21: ten bound material packages
preserve complete source geometry/collision; independent comparisons, four
rehashed faults, all 804,029 source rays and glTF validation pass. A separate
candidate excludes exactly one invisible water collider. Two real encrypted
Linux/Vulkan clients load the full scene, share four projection materials and
47 actual images, and pass visibility/readiness/rebase checks. Per-client base
RGBA CPU image data is 1,589,649,408 bytes (not total memory). The actual-map
survey records 27 clear starts and 41 rejected routes; movement, lighting,
mips/resources, water and broader camera/adoption remain open. Town stays the
default. All work stays local. [Evidence and limits](../FOREST_RUNTIME.md).
